          There are a few things every design team needs to be effective. Two of
          the most essential are trust and communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a deeper dive into the Kumu Product Design team’s day-to-day,
          meeting cadences, rituals, and anything else that helped build that
          trust within the design team and has helped us stay connected and
          efficient.
        </p>
        <p>But first, some quick caveats:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Kumu is a remote-first company.</strong> The design team
            works fully remotely. Hence, most of our processes will be weighted
            towards keeping us efficient and effective (and sane) in our remote
            way of working.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >This is about the “design team” process, not the “product team”
              process.</strong
            >
            Kumu product designers are members of the “design team” (horizontal)
            and the “product team” or, as we call it, a “pod” (vertical). The
            horizontal team is responsible for maintaining consistency across
            the product and keeping a high-quality bar, elevating the craft of
            design in the company. The vertical team is responsible for shipping
            and delivering product improvements and building expertise within
            focused areas.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Daily Rituals</h2>
        <h3>"Stand-up" or Status Updates</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Who:</strong> Product designers</li>
          <li>
            <strong>What:</strong> Each designer sends a list of things they
            worked on yesterday and are working on today
          </li>
          <li><strong>When:</strong> Every Tuesday to Friday, 9:30 am</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Why:</strong> To be aware of what others are working on and
            if they are blocked and need help
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is the only daily ritual we have. We used to have this as a
          15-min call to hear updates from everyone but, as we’ve grown in
          number, this took up too much time and was inefficient. So far,
          sending updates via Slack has helped. This ritual allows everyone to
          keep tabs on what everyone is doing or has done over the week (or past
          few weeks).

        <h2>Weekly Rituals</h2>

        <h3>Warm-Up</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Who:</strong> Product designers</li>
          <li><strong>What:</strong> Kick off the week together</li>
          <li><strong>When:</strong> Every Monday, 1:00–2:00 pm</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Why:</strong> To ease into the work week with something
            light and fun
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Every Monday, we kick off the week together. The hour-long meeting
          consists of four parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Weekend update (15 minutes):</strong> We each go around the
            room and share a quick highlight or two of what we did over the
            weekend (if we’re using Google Meet, one person starts and then
            nominates the next person). It helps us start the week on a positive
            note and allows us to ease into the workweek.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tasks and Blockers (15 minutes):</strong> We look at our
            kanban board and discuss the statuses/progress of our tasks. This
            also helps us see if any designer has a blocker or is overloaded and
            needs help in the coming week.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Critique/meeting schedule (15 minutes):</strong> We plan our
            critiques and team meetings in a Notion doc ahead of time so
            everyone knows what to expect. We go around the room again (one
            person starts and then nominates the next person) and each person
            decides if they have a project they’d like critiqued during the
            week.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Announcements (15 minutes):</strong> We share org-wide or
            company-wide announcements and updates specific to the design team.
            This includes topics like branding alignments with the brand team,
            updates to the design system, new company policies, hiring plans,
            and designer candidate progress.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design Critique</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Who:</strong> Product designers, and any guests the
            presenter chooses to invite (e.g., their PM, tech lead, researcher)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What:</strong> Run through a list of designs submitted for
            Critique on Tuesday
          </li>
          <li><strong>When:</strong> Every Wednesday from 10:30–12:00 pm</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Why:</strong> To move projects along, help anyone who gets
            stuck, and share context with the team
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Design critiques at Kumu are not product reviews. Critiques are not
          the forum to suggest new ideas, make major product decisions, or
          determine product roadmaps. It is a safe space for feedback
          independent from roadmap decision-making. Our design critiques focus
          on unblocking problems and generating ideas, elevating the quality of
          the designs, encouraging consistency in the product, and sharing
          context.
        </p>

        <h3>Cooldown</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Who:</strong> Product designers</li>
          <li><strong>What:</strong> Wrap up the week</li>
          <li><strong>When:</strong> Every Friday 4:00–5:00 pm</li>
          <li><strong>Why:</strong> To hang out and relax</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In remote settings where water-cooler conversations are hard to come
          by, time to hang out needs to be carved out actively. Cooldowns are
          our time to bond and have fun as a team—both important to building
          trust in each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would usually do one of three things here: <strong>Play</strong>,
          <strong>Learn</strong>, or <strong>Chat</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Monthly and Quarterly Rituals</h2>

        <h3>Retrospectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Who:</strong> Product designers</li>
          <li>
            <strong>What:</strong> An opportunity to review our current
            processes and team-wide responsibilities
          </li>
          <li><strong>When:</strong> Twice a month, every other Thursday</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Why:</strong> To create a space for feedback on our design
            processes or our team
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Offsites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Who:</strong> Product designers (and interns)</li>
          <li>
            <strong>What:</strong> A full day of activities outside the office
          </li>
          <li><strong>When:</strong> Quarterly</li>
          <li><strong>Why:</strong> To learn, bond, and (maybe) brainstorm</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We have two types of teambuilding offsites: one with the Design team
          and one with the product teams.

          Philippine Airlines is the flag carrier of the Philippines. It flies
          approximately 15 million passengers per year.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018, PAL wanted to increase their online revenue by 20%. Their
          digital marketing team decided that improving the website can help
          achieve this.
        </p>

        <div class="challenge-box">
          <blockquote>
            "How can we improve the website so PAL increases online revenue by
            20%?"
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <h3 class="section-title">Navigating organizational complexity</h3>
        <p>
          I joined this project mid-stream, after research was complete but
          before design execution. The project team needed a second designer,
          but within two weeks, I became the lead designer when the original
          designer transitioned to another project.
        </p>
        <p>
          This created an immediate challenge: I needed to quickly build
          credibility with stakeholders who had already invested months in
          research, while also identifying gaps in the proposed approach. The
          research was solid, but the
          <strong
            >recommended solutions didn't account for PAL's technical
            constraints or organizational realities</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key constraints I discovered:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Legacy booking engine:</strong> The booking flow was powered
            by a third-party system (Amadeus) that couldn't be redesigned
            without significant backend work
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marketing vs. Product tension:</strong> Marketing wanted
            maximum promotional real estate; Product wanted clean,
            conversion-focused design
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mobile-first mandate vs. desktop revenue:</strong> 60% of
            traffic was mobile, but 70% of revenue came from desktop bookings
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Timeline pressure:</strong> 6-month deadline to launch
            before peak holiday booking season
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My role became less about "designing the perfect solution" and more
          about
          <strong
            >navigating constraints to deliver maximum impact within
            organizational realities</strong
          >.

        <h3 class="section-title">Issues</h3>
        <p>
          The heuristic evaluation identified several issues, most of which were
          related to website navigation and accessibility. These issues affected
          how customers discovered content.
        </p>

        <div class="image-grid">

        <p>
          We also analyzed and benchmarked PAL's sitemap against those of other
          airlines. By analyzing the sitemap, we learned that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Key revenue-generating content—like baggage information or seat
            upgrade information—were buried deep within the site.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content wasn't always found where customers expect to find it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some pages were repeated redundantly through out the website. This
            was information overload for the website's users.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="section-title">Aligning stakeholders around constraints</h3>
        <p>
          The heuristic evaluation identified 20+ issues. We couldn't fix
          everything in 6 months, especially with the booking engine off-limits.
          I needed to align stakeholders around
          <strong>what we could realistically change</strong> and
          <strong>what would drive the most revenue impact</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I facilitated a prioritization workshop with Marketing, Product, and
          Engineering leads:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Mapped issues to business impact:</strong> Which issues were
            blocking revenue vs. just "nice to have"?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Assessed technical feasibility:</strong> Which fixes
            required backend changes vs. frontend-only?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Identified quick wins:</strong> What could we ship in phases
            to show early progress?
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>The strategic trade-offs we made:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Deprioritized booking flow redesign</strong> (backend
            constraints) - Focused on
            <strong>improving discoverability of ancillary revenue</strong>
            (baggage, upgrades, insurance)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compromised on promotional real estate</strong> (Marketing's
            request) - Gave them Flight Promotions section but
            <strong>separated it from Travel Extras</strong> to reduce cognitive
            load
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Invested heavily in mobile IA</strong> (where users
            struggled most) - Accepted that desktop would get less attention
            despite higher revenue
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This alignment process took 3 weeks but was critical. Without it, we
          would have designed solutions that Engineering couldn't build or
          Marketing wouldn't approve.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Design strategy</h3>
        <p>
          Given our constraints (legacy booking engine, 6-month timeline,
          mobile-first mandate), I focused on three strategic bets:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Fix information architecture</strong> - This was
            frontend-only, high-impact, and could be done without backend
            changes
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Elevate ancillary revenue products</strong> - Baggage,
            upgrades, and insurance were buried but drove 20% of online revenue
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mobile-first execution</strong> - Even though desktop drove
            more revenue, mobile users were bouncing at 2x the rate
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Each solution below was designed to deliver measurable impact while
          respecting our technical and organizational constraints.
        </p>

        <div class="case-study-item">
          <h3>Restructure the information architecture</h3>
          <p>
            In reconstructing PAL’s information architecture, we minimized
            redundancies—like About Us information—in both main and footer
            navigations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We finalized a sitemap that focused in providing logical and
            intuitive paths to accomplishing user tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, finding information still takes a user deeper into
            the site but, now, the website is structured to make it easier to
            locate information from the home page.

            By placing these options in an area that is consistently above the

            During the study, we learned that a huge percentage of customers
            viewed the website using their mobile phones.
          </p>
          <p>

            Key actions (booking a flight, checking in, etc) are within reach of
            the customers thumbs and provide a quick way to complete key tasks.
            And below these key actions are the revenue-generating content like
            baggage allowance, seat upgrades, and travel insurance.

        <h3>The Mobile Paradox: Designing for Traffic, Not Revenue</h3>
        <p>
          This was the hardest strategic decision: investing heavily in mobile
          when desktop drove most revenue. I made the case to leadership that
          <strong>mobile was a conversion problem, not a traffic problem</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>Data showed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mobile users had 2x higher bounce rate than desktop</li>
          <li>
            Mobile users who <em>did</em> convert had 30% lower cart abandonment
            (once they committed)
          </li>
          <li>Mobile traffic was growing 15% YoY; desktop was flat</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The bet:
          <strong>Fix mobile conversion now to capture future growth</strong>.
          If we only optimized for today's revenue (desktop), we'd miss the
          shift happening in user behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          This required convincing stakeholders to invest in a platform that
          wasn't currently driving revenue. The key was reframing mobile not as
          "low revenue" but as "<strong>untapped potential</strong>."

              >Joining a project mid-stream requires rapid credibility
              building.</strong
            >
            I had two weeks to understand months of research, identify gaps, and
            earn stakeholder trust. The key was asking informed questions, not
            challenging decisions without data.

              prioritization.</strong
            >
            The legacy booking engine felt like a limitation, but it forced us
            to focus on high-impact, frontend-only changes (IA, content
            discovery, mobile UX) that we could ship quickly.
          </li>

            <strong
              >Stakeholder alignment is harder than design execution.</strong
            >
            The actual design work took 8 weeks. Getting Marketing, Product, and
            Engineering aligned on priorities took 3 weeks. That alignment work
            was the most valuable thing I did - it prevented months of rework.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mobile-first doesn't mean mobile-only.</strong> We invested
            heavily in mobile (60% of traffic) while still respecting that
            desktop drove 70% of revenue. The strategic bet was that fixing
            mobile conversion would unlock future growth.

              >Measure everything, but focus on leading indicators.</strong
            >
            We tracked 15+ metrics, but the ones that mattered most were:
            homepage - booking flow traffic (+100%), pages per session (+28%),
            and bounce rate reduction (-13%). These predicted the revenue growth
            before it showed up in sales data.

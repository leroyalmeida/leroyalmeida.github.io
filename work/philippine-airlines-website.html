          Philippine Airlines is the flag carrier of the Philippines. It flies

          In 2018, PAL wanted to increase their online revenue by 20%. Their
          digital marketing team decided that improving the website can help
          achieve this.
        </p>

          I joined the project when the research was already completed. The
          project team needed support to complete the interaction and visual
          designs. I joined as the second designer but eventually took over as
          the lead designer.

        <p>
          The heuristic evaluation identified several issues, most of which were
          related to website navigation and accessibility. These issues affected
          how customers discovered content.

          We also analyzed and benchmarked PAL's sitemap against those of other
          airlines. By analyzing the sitemap, we learned that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Key revenue-generating content—like baggage information or seat
            upgrade information—were buried deep within the site.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content wasn't always found where customers expect to find it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some pages were repeated redundantly through out the website. This
            was information overload for the website's users.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Restructure the information architecture</h3>
          <p>
            In reconstructing PAL’s information architecture, we minimized
            redundancies—like About Us information—in both main and footer
            navigations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We finalized a sitemap that focused in providing logical and
            intuitive paths to accomplishing user tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, finding information still takes a user deeper into
            the site but, now, the website is structured to make it easier to
            locate information from the home page.

            is also organized in a way that makes sense to customers. The new
            design provides quick access to previously underexposed self-service
            content.

            These four key customer jobs-to-be-done are now accessible from a

            We split the current design’s all-the-promos-are-here section into
            two distinct sections, Flight Promotions and Travel Extras. Grouping
            information in this manner makes it easier for customers to identify
            and understand it.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Flight Promotions offers an easy way to discover cheap trips.
            </li>
            <li>
              Travel Extras include promotions for travel insurance and lounges.
              These provide added revenue for the airlines.

          <h3>Improve visibility of revenue-generating airline products</h3>
          <p>
            The new design puts an emphasis on purchasing extra baggage
            allowance, getting seat upgrades, and buying travel insurances.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time, these three comprised about 20% of PAL's current online
            revenue.
          </p>
          <p>
            By placing these options in an area that is consistently above the
            fold in most devices, we hope to increase its accessibility to
            customers who need it.

          <p>
            The new design makes sure that the website is accessible—and
            beautiful —from a mobile view.
          </p>
          <p>
            Key actions (booking a flight, checking in, etc) are within reach of
            the customers thumbs and provide a quick way to complete key tasks.
            And below these key actions are the revenue-generating content like
            baggage allowance, seat upgrades, and travel insurance.
          </p>

            Lastly, the navigation sticks to the top to provide quick access to

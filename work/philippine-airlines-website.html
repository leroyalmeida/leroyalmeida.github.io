        <p>
          Philippine Airlines (PAL) is the flag carrier of the Philippines,
          flying approximately 15 million passengers per year.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018, PAL wanted to increase their online revenue by 20%. Their
          digital marketing team decided that improving the website can help
          achieve this.
        </p>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          "How can we improve the website so PAL increases online revenue by
          20%?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I joined the project when the research was already completed. The
          project team needed support to complete the interaction and visual
          designs. I joined as the second designer but eventually took over as
          the lead designer.

        <h2>Issues</h2>
        <p>
          The heuristic evaluation identified several issues, most of which were
          related to website navigation and accessibility:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Key revenue-generating content</strong>—like baggage
            information or seat upgrade information—were buried deep within the
            site.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Content wasn't always found</strong> where customers expect
            to find it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Some pages were repeated redundantly</strong> throughout the
            website, causing information overload.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Design Solutions</h2>

        <div class="case-study-item">
          <h3>Restructure the information architecture</h3>
          <p>
            We minimized redundancies (like About Us info) and focused on
            logical paths. The new structure makes finding information easier
            from the homepage.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../images/philippine-airlines-website/image_03.png"
            alt="New Sitemap"
          />
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-item">
          <h3>Make important travel information more discoverable</h3>
          <p>
            The new main navigation focuses on providing everything that a
            customer might need in a more intuitive location, including
            self-service content.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-item">
          <h3>Place primary actions in an accessible location</h3>
          <p>
            We identified four key jobs-to-be-done: Booking a flight, Checking
            in, Managing a booking, Checking flight status. These are now
            accessible from a single form that is always above the fold.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-item">
          <h3>Increase contrast of flight deals vs other promos</h3>
          <p>
            We split promotions into "Flight Promotions" (cheap trips) and
            "Travel Extras" (insurance, lounges), making it easier for customers
            to identify deals.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-item">
          <h3>Improve visibility of revenue-generating airline products</h3>
          <p>
            The new design emphasizes purchasing extra baggage allowance, seat
            upgrades, and travel insurance (previously 20% of online revenue) by
            placing them in consistently visible areas.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-item">
          <h3>Design for mobile-first</h3>
          <p>
            A huge percentage of customers use mobile. The new design ensures
            accessibility and beauty on mobile, with key actions within thumb
            reach.

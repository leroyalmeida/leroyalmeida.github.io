          There's a version of this case study where I walk you through an
          elaborate design system, a multi-step configuration flow, template
          libraries, drag-and-drop mapping interfaces. That's what the project
          looked like on paper when it landed on my desk.
        </p>
        <p>Instead, I shipped a single button.</p>
        <p>
          This is a case study about why that was the harder decision, and what
          senior design work actually looks like when you're building for
          learning instead of building for scale.

        <h2>The feature nobody asked for</h2>
        <p>
          Our CTO had just announced a pivot: simplify dashboards, make AI the
          primary entry point, stop competing with BI tools. Two weeks later,
          our most strategic customer said they wouldn't adopt without one
          thing: automated PowerPoint generation from dashboards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The irony wasn't lost on anyone. We'd committed to moving away from
          dashboard-centric design, and now we were being asked to build a
          feature that exports dashboards to PowerPoint.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought it was a mistake, and I said so. The feature doubled down on
          dashboards when leadership had just committed to simplifying them. I
          asked the question that mattered: were we building for the deliverable
          (a PowerPoint file) or for the generation (AI reasoning and
          synthesis)? The first felt like traditional BI tooling. The second
          would advance our direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The response was clear: this customer wouldn't adopt without it.
          Customer commitments override strategic purity.
        </p>
        <p>That's when the real design work started.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>The spec that couldn't decide</h2>
        <p>
          The product doc had a tell. The title said "[redacted] Steering
          Committee Reporting," singular and specific. But the user interaction
          diagram showed template selection, dashboard configuration, and
          mapping interfaces—plural, generic, platform-shaped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those two framings required completely different designs. A
          customer-specific solution means hardcoded templates, zero
          configuration UI, and a timeline measured in weeks. A platform feature
          means selection interfaces, mapping logic, and months of work. The
          spec was describing both, which meant it was describing neither.
        </p>
        <p>
          I asked two designers about the spec. Both flagged the same tension
          I'd seen: one questioned whether it would scale beyond this customer,
          the other suggested keeping scope to a POC/MVP. Both asked whether
          in-product editing belonged in the first version. That gave me
          confidence to escalate.
        </p>
        <p>
          That gave me confidence to bring pointed questions to my PM. Not
          open-ended "can you clarify the scope" questions, but specific ones:
          "The flow shows 'Select Dashboards' but scope says customer-specific.
          Which is the source of truth?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer clarified everything. We'd build a hardcoded MVP for this
          one customer. One button, zero configuration. If it validated the
          pattern, we'd generalize later.
        </p>
        <p>Now I had something I could actually design.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>The case for doing less</h2>
        <p>
          With scope locked to a single customer, I had a choice. I could still
          build configuration UI, preview screens, and in-product editing,
          treating this customer as the first user of a platform feature. Or I
          could strip the design down to the minimum that would validate whether
          anyone wanted this thing at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I argued for the minimum, and I had to make the case for each thing I
          wanted to cut.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Preview before download.</strong> The spec floated this as an
          obvious inclusion. But we had no evidence users wanted it. Adding
          preview would mean more UI, more edge cases, and a longer timeline,
          all to validate an assumption we could test more cheaply by shipping
          without it. If users complain about not having preview, we'll have
          learned something. If they don't, we'll have saved weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>In-product editing.</strong> The spec mentioned this as a
          "future consideration," which is how scope creep enters a project
          without anyone noticing. I pushed to remove it from the conversation
          entirely. If users need to edit, they'll do it in PowerPoint, where
          they already know the interface and where we don't have to build
          anything.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Discoverability.</strong> The instinct is always to promote
          new features, to put them in front of users and see what happens. I
          argued for the opposite. The feature would live behind a single button
          on a single dashboard, with no promotion and no AI assistant
          suggestions. We're validating the pattern with one customer. If it
          works, we'll scale discoverability. If it doesn't, we'll have kept our
          failure cheap.
        </p>

        <p>
          What remained was the smallest thing that could validate the
          hypothesis: a button that generates a four-slide PowerPoint deck from
          hardcoded templates and AI-written summaries.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Why less is harder</h2>
        <p>Cutting scope sounds like the easy path. It's not.</p>
        <p>
          Every feature I cut was a conversation I had to have. Preview felt
          obvious to stakeholders, so I had to explain why obvious isn't the
          same as validated. In-product editing had already been mentioned in
          the spec, so removing it meant pushing back on documented assumptions.
          Minimal discoverability goes against every instinct product teams have
          about launching features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minimal design requires you to articulate what you're trading away and
          why the trade is worth it. You have to be precise about what you're
          learning and how you'll know if you're wrong. You have to resist the
          pull of "while we're at it" thinking, which is how small projects
          become big ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building more is often the path of least resistance. Building less
          requires conviction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>What happens next</h2>
        <p>
          The MVP is scoped and designed. Now we find out if the bet pays off.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What success looks like:</strong> The customer generates their
          weekly deck without help from our support team. Prep time drops below
          15 minutes. We see zero support involvement for four consecutive
          weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What failure looks like:</strong> Abandonment after two
          attempts. Decks that require 30+ minutes of editing. Users reverting
          to manual creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What we're learning either way:</strong> Do users want all
          four slides or just a subset? Do they edit text more than visuals?
          What do they add manually after generation? Each answer shapes what
          the generalized version looks like, if we build one.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>The version I'm not building yet</h2>
        <p>
          If the MVP validates, we'll need to generalize. I've already explored
          what that looks like, because part of designing a minimal first step
          is knowing what the second step might be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core challenge is mapping: how do customers specify which
          dashboards feed into which slides when both sides are flexible?
        </p>

                Simple for users but rigid for us, requiring a maintained

              <td>
                Users select dashboards and templates independently, then the AI
                proposes a mapping for review
              </td>
              <td>
                Flexible and aligned with our product direction, but complex to
                build and dependent on AI quality

                Maximum control but high cognitive load, and doesn't leverage

              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          My recommendation is AI-assisted mapping. It's the only approach that
          advances our assistant-first bet rather than contradicting it. But
          that recommendation stays on the shelf until we've validated that the
          core pattern works.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="boxed-section">
        <h2>Key learnings</h2>
        <p>
          I started this project skeptical that it should exist. The strategy
          said we were moving away from dashboards, and here we were building
          dashboard export. It felt like backsliding.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I've learned is that strategic alignment isn't binary. This
          feature contradicts our stated direction and unblocks a critical
          customer. Both are true. The skill is holding that tension long enough
          to find the version that serves the customer without derailing the
          strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, that version turned out to be very small. No
          configuration, no preview, no editing, no promotion. Just enough to
          learn whether the pattern has legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Senior design work isn't always about building sophisticated systems.
          Sometimes it's about having the conviction to build less, the clarity
          to explain why, and the patience to let the results tell you what to
          do next.
        </p>
        <p>I shipped a single button. That was the design.</p>

      <section>
        <p>ING Philippines' has two 24/7-customer service channels.</p>
        <p>
          First is In-app Messages. This functions a lot like emails or SMS
          messages where customers can send a message and can come back to it
          later. These in-app messages are usually responded to within 24 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second channel is Live Chat. This is the channel for urgent
          concerns where customers can get the help of a customer care agent to
          resolve their issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem with Live Chat is customers often wait ~10 minutes (or
          more) to talk to a customer care agent. This wait is a very unpleasant
          experience, especially if you have an urgent issue that is
          time-critical, like reporting fraudulent or unauthorized transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another problem is that reaching out via Live Chat became the
          preferred channel. This happened because customers were often unable
          to find solutions in the FAQ or in the website. And, since there is no
          prioritization functionality in the chat, a lot of the "trivial"
          queries sent through the Live Chat occupied customer agents' time and
          effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the growing concerns around providing quality customer
          service, ING's leadership challenged us with the following:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Primary:</strong> When a user with an issue contacts
            support, I want to address their issue as fast as possible so that
            they can get back to doing whatever they need to get done.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secondary:</strong> When a user contacts the bank about an
            issue, I want the experience to be pleasant and seamless so that
            they feel that they are taken care of by ING.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Provide support as fast as possible:</strong> Customers
            should not be spending too much time waiting for an answer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Provide correct and helpful answers the first time:</strong>
            We don't want customers repeatedly coming back for the same issue.
            As much as possible, we want to solve it the first time around.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Minimize the time it takes to provide a solution:</strong>
            We want to resolve the issue as fast as possible. If the issue has
            no true solution, we try to alleviate the customer's concern.

        <h2 class="section-title">Issues</h2>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) are not easily accessible</h3>
        <p>
          When we interviewed a few customers, 11 out of 12 said that they'd
          look at the available self-service options first before reaching out
          to customer support.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when using the ING app, customers often went to ING's
          communication channels, Live Chat and Send a Message, and barely used
          the self-service option.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I investigated why customers barely used FAQs, I learned that the
          entry point to FAQs was barely noticeable by customers. There were
          several reasons for this:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Poor placement:</strong> The entry point was at the top
            right of the screen. This part of the screen is often overlooked.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Poor contrast:</strong> The thin line icon contrasted
            horribly against the bright orange background of the header. It even
            failed contrast tests, yikes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The floating action button has more affordance:</strong> The
            call-to-action for the communication channels is a very visible
            bright orange button contrasting against a white background. It is
            also placed at the bottom left of the screen which is very near to
            the thumbs making it very easy to click. tldr; very very very easy
            to click.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="image-container">
          <div class="image-aspect-box">
            <img src="../images/ing-help-center/02.webp" alt="Issues Visual" />
          </div>
          <p class="caption">
            When opening Help Center, the messaging options are more prominent
            than self-service options
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Self-service content and structure are not updated</h3>
        <p>
          The content in the app's FAQ section was made by the Marketing team.
          They made it in anticipation of what customers might ask. It also
          hasn't been updated since the app was launched two years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Help content in the app was also different from that in the
          website, because the website was more frequently updated by the
          Marketing team.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Chat transcripts between bank and the customer are not automatically
          saved
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a regulatory requirement, the bank needs to be able to keep records
          of its communications with a customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the chat tool doesn't automatically save the transcript of a
          conversation between bank and customer, agents need to copy and record
          this manually. This creates a lot of extra work for customer agents
          and adds an unnecessary 2-3 minutes to their average handling time.
        </p>

        <h3>Agents can only talk to one customer at a time</h3>
        <p>
          The existing chat platform allowed an agent to speak to only one
          customer at a time. The bank usually had 3-4 customer care agents
          available at any time and these agents could answer queries at an
          average handling time of ~15 minutes. This meant that, if more than 4
          customers sent a question via Live Chat at the same time, some of
          these customers would need to wait to talk to a customer care agent.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Customer's messages are only received by the bank once a "connection"
          has been established
        </h3>
        <p>
          This was a technical limitation of the chat platform we were using. As
          an effect of this limitation and the previous cited issue—i.e., being
          able to talk to only customer at a time—customer's often need to
          actively wait for an agent to be connected.
        </p>
        <p>
          This "active waiting time" meant that customers needed to keep their
          app session alive by tapping on the screen. Otherwise, they get
          disconnected from the chat and they have to reconnect and queue again.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          There wasn't one solution that would solve all the issues we have. The
          leadership team wanted to have a chatbot but it wasn't something that
          could be implemented quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, we looked at several improvements which varied in terms of impact
          and effort required. When thinking about possible solutions, we
          considered the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How effective is it against the jobs-to-be done we set?</li>
          <li>What's the level of change necessary to our existing product?</li>
          <li>What's the effort to build this?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Make FAQs more accessible</h3>
        <p>
          I redesigned the FAQs to be the first touchpoint for customers looking
          to get support. This way, customers are encouraged to look for answers
          to their issues first before contacting support. This is aligned with
          our guiding principle of providing support as fast as possible and
          minimizing the time to provide a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few stakeholders wanted to actively discourage customers from using
          Live Chat. I disagreed with this. We should not discourage customers
          from immediately reaching out to get support from agents.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we want customers to self-serve first, we also recognize that
          there are occasions where getting human assistance is better—like,
          reporting a fraud or blocking a card. In these kinds of
          "high-touchpoint, high-urgency" scenarios, customers should be getting
          the correct help as fast as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          This solution was a 2/5 on the level-of-change scale, a 2/5 on the
          effort scale, and a 5/5 on the impact scale.
        </p>

            visit Help Center
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Improve Help content and structure</h3>
        <p>
          We studied how different apps and digital banks structure their help
          sections. We looked at apps like Grab, Citibank, Revolut to see how
          they structured their Help content. We did this to understand what
          patterns already exist and are well-understood by our customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then we analyzed the current state of our Help content—what
          customers were frequently asking and what was currently on our
          website—and compared it to what we wanted the structure to be.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          This solution was a 1/5 on the level-of-change scale, a 2/5 on the
          effort scale, and a 3/5 on the impact scale. This was also a
          pre-requisite to the Chatbot effort.

            architecture of our Help content for both app and the website

        </div>

        <h3>Add chat history</h3>
        <p>
          Customer experience-wise, adding chat history allowed customers to
          view their past chats with the bank. This was helpful because,
          previously, chat conversations containing instructions or possible
          solutions would disappear when the chat ended. Now they are kept in a
          single, easy-to-access location.
        </p>
        <p>
          For banking operations, adding chat history allowed agents to view
          past conversations the customer had with the bank without navigating
          away from their current conversation with the customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding chat history also reduced each agent's after-chat work like
          copying the chat transcript or re-sending instructions to customers
          via in-app message so that it didn't disappear after the chat ended.
          In total, after-chat work took up ~1 hour of each agent's time every
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this improvement helped decrease the average handling time
          which, in effect, allowed customer agents to service more customers
          per day.

          We want to eliminate the time our customers spend actively waiting for
          an agent to get connected to them. Customers should be able to put
          aside their phone and continue on with their life while waiting for a
          response from the bank.
        </p>
        <p>
          Synchronous chat means that customers and customer care agents have to
          be "connected" to send or receive messages successfully. Making the
          chat asynchronous means that customers can send their messages without
          waiting for an agent to get connected and that agents—once they are
          available and are connected to the customer—can read the messages the
          customer sent.

        <h3>Add a chatbot</h3>
        <p>
          We made a chatbot! (This was a lot of work, so it really needs a
          separate case study.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Customers still tend to reach out to customer support even if answers
          to their questions are available in the FAQs section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding a chatbot allowed ING to surface relevant FAQs in a user's chat
          conversation with the bank. This aligns with our guiding principle of
          providing support as fast as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, this was actually one of the main reasons why we needed to
          restructure our Help content. We needed Help content that was concise
          and reusable across the Help Center, the website, AND the chatbot.
        </p>
        <p>
          ING Philippines' Live Chat functionality also integrates with FB
          Messenger. In the ideal end state, the chatbot is be able to surface
          FAQs in FB Messenger as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, adding a chatbot allowed prioritization of customer issues or
          concerns by "filtering" inquiries that are answerable through the
          FAQs. With the chatbot, we could provide faster support to concerns
          like someone hacking a customer account over less urgent ones like
          inquiries about a delayed check deposit. This will help minimize the
          time to provide customer's a resolution.

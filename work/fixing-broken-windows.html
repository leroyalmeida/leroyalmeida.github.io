        <p>
          In 1982, James Wilson and George Kelling wrote about an idea that
          later became known as the Broken Window Theory. This theory suggests
          that visible signs of disorder, such as broken windows in a
          neighborhood, can contribute to an increase in crime and a decline in
          community well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          The theory says that if a broken window isn't fixed in a building, it
          shows that nobody cares about that place. This can make people think
          the area is neglected and lacks control, which makes it easier for
          serious crimes and bad behavior to happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, that if communities take care of small signs of disorder and fix
          broken windows, graffiti, or other signs of neglect quickly, they can
          make things more orderly and in control. This can stop bad behavior
          and make people feel safer and better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like disorder in a neighborhood is bad, ignoring small problems
          in a digital product can convey a sense of neglect, contribute to a
          negative perception of the product, and make the user experience
          worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          In UX, we can think of these as small usability issues—elements that
          make the user experience less smooth or confusing. Things like unclear
          buttons, broken links, or inconsistent design elements.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Why fixing broken windows matters</h3>
        <p>
          Fixing these broken windows has remarkable potential in product
          development:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User satisfaction.</strong> Even small inefficiencies can
            compound frustration for users who perform repetitive actions daily.
            Fixing these seemingly insignificant issues is powerful. Often more
            so than creating new features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Usability and trust.</strong> When we address minor issues,
            we make the product easier to use and signal that we care about
            quality. This builds trust and loyalty. Users see their feedback
            acknowledged and acted upon.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business impact.</strong> When users encounter fewer
            obstacles, they engage more, retain longer, and recommend the
            product to others. Quality improvements directly influence growth
            metrics.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h3 class="section-title">How we identified broken windows</h3>
        <p>
          At Kumu, we didn't stumble upon these issues randomly. We built a
          systematic process to surface quality problems that users had learned
          to live with.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>App store reviews.</strong> We analyzed user reviews from the
          iOS App Store and Google Play Store, looking for recurring complaints
          and friction points. These reviews often captured frustrations that
          users experienced repeatedly but never formally reported. Comments
          like "why is this so hard to find?" or "I keep accidentally tapping
          the wrong button."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>User research synthesis.</strong> We reviewed findings from
          user research sessions, specifically looking for moments of
          hesitation, mis-taps, and workarounds. These micro-frictions rarely
          surfaced in post-session feedback but were visible in observed
          behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Heuristic audit.</strong> We conducted a systematic review
          against basic usability heuristics—consistency, visibility, error
          prevention, accessibility. This caught issues like contrast failures
          and inconsistent button styles that no single user would report but
          that degraded overall perception.
        </p>
        <p>
          This combination of qualitative feedback and systematic review gave us
          a comprehensive picture of where broken windows existed across the
          product.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h3 class="section-title">From audit to alignment</h3>
        <p>
          These fixes weren't arbitrary improvements. They were guided by a
          design system we created for Kumu.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design system was unified across iOS and Android, defining
          standards for color, typography, iconography, and component behavior.
          It gave us a clear benchmark: when the live product deviated from the
          system, that was a broken window.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Icon consistency.</strong> The system specified a single
            icon style and rules for outline vs filled states. The audit
            revealed the app used multiple icon sets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Button standards.</strong> The system defined Kumu Blue
            (#499CE4) as the primary action color with no gradients. The audit
            found buttons in various colors and gradient styles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contrast requirements.</strong> The system set minimum
            contrast ratios for text and interactive elements. The audit
            identified screens that failed these standards.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Having an established system transformed the audit from subjective
          ("this feels inconsistent") to objective ("this doesn't match the
          spec"). It also made prioritization easier. We weren't asking for
          design preferences, we were asking to align the product with
          agreed-upon standards.

        <p>
          Below are some of the highest-impact fixes we made, organized by
          theme. Each category targeted a clear success metric:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Navigation clarity:</strong> Reduce "Where do I find X?"
            complaints
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contrast & accessibility:</strong> Improve legibility and
            meet accessibility standards
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consistency:</strong> Reduce user confusion around primary
            actions and interface patterns
          </li>
        </ul>

              <h6>Before</h6>
              <p>
                Customer feedback and usability testing revealed that users were
                unfamiliar with our menu icons and relied on trial and error to
                find the desired content.

              <h6>Before</h6>
              <p>
                Users had difficulty reading low-contrast text. They also
                confused unselected toggles for disabled toggles because the
                grays were too light.

              <h6>After</h6>
              <p>
                We removed tiny, low-contrast text and went from light grays to
                darker ones (for both font and toggles). These went a long way
                toward legibility and usability.

            </div>
          </div>

                Users frequently complained that Kumu's notifications were

                Kumu used different icon styles across its interface. This

                Kumu's user interface featured gradients based on its brand

                The Wallet screen was the only screen in our whole app that used
                dark mode. No one knew why. It felt very inconsistent with the
                whole experience. The copy also used brand colors which

          Incremental improvements are key to success in product development. By
          recognizing that addressing broken windows with these quick wins can
          yield significant results, we can enhance user satisfaction, improve
          usability, boost engagement, and build trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          Getting into the habit of constantly fixing broken windows can improve
          your brand, set you apart from competitors, and show users that you
          listen to them and that they can trust you. Most importantly, it helps
          improve your product and the lives of your users.

            <strong>Small inefficiencies almost always go unreported.</strong>
            Users get accustomed to friction—a sort of "learned helplessness."
            Relying exclusively on direct feedback misses problems users have
            stopped complaining about. Identifying these requires proactive
            research: reviewing app store comments, analyzing user research
            sessions, and conducting systematic audits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessibility improvements benefit everyone.</strong> Better
            contrast and larger touch targets improve usability for all users,
            not just those with specific needs. Framing accessibility as
            universal usability made it easier to prioritize.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A design system makes quality objective.</strong> Without a
            system, quality discussions become debates about preference. With a
            system, they become alignment checks. "Does this match the spec?" is
            easier to prioritize than "I think this looks better."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quality work requires a business case.</strong>
            Design changes like these often seem like vanity work. Getting them
            prioritized requires reframing: not "design cleanup" but "reducing
            user friction" and "building trust." Connect fixes to user
            complaints and observed behavior.

            >
            The fixes shown here took a few weeks to design and implement.
            Getting leadership buy-in to prioritize quality over new features
            required sustained effort—presenting user feedback, demonstrating
            the value of consistency, and showing results over time.

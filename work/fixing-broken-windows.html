            <p>In 1982, James Wilson and George Kelling wrote about an idea that later became known as the Broken Window Theory. This theory suggests that visible signs of disorder, such as broken windows in a neighborhood, can contribute to an increase in crime and a decline in community well-being.</p>
            <p>The theory says that if a broken window isn't fixed in a building, it shows that nobody cares about that place. This can make people think the area is neglected and lacks control, which makes it easier for serious crimes and bad behavior to happen.</p>
            <p>And, that if communities take care of small signs of disorder and fix broken windows, graffiti, or other signs of neglect quickly, they can make things more orderly and in control. This can stop bad behavior and make people feel safer and better.</p>
            <p>Just like disorder in a neighborhood is bad, ignoring small problems in a digital product can convey a sense of neglect, contribute to a negative perception of the product, and make the user experience worse.</p>
            <p>In UX, we can think of these as small usability issues — elements that make the user experience less smooth or confusing. Things like unclear buttons, broken links, or inconsistent design elements.</p>

            <h3>The Power of Fixing Broken Windows</h3>
            <p>Fixing these broken windows has remarkable potential in product development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Satisfaction.</strong> Even small inefficiencies can compound frustration for users who perform repetitive actions daily. Fixing these seemingly insignificant issues is powerful, often more so than creating new features. By addressing user feedback and making quick wins to improve the user interface or usability, we can significantly enhance customer satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Usability.</strong> Fixing broken windows leads to an improved user experience by enhancing the usability of a product. When we address minor issues, such as confusing buttons or unclear instructions, we make the product easier and more intuitive to use. This, in turn, reduces user frustration and increases their confidence in navigating the product.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Engagement.</strong> When users encounter fewer obstacles and frustrations in using a product, they are more likely to engage with it. By optimizing the user experience, we can encourage users to spend more time interacting with the product, exploring its features, and achieving their goals. Increased engagement can lead to higher user retention and improved business outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Trust and Loyalty.</strong> By promptly fixing broken windows, we demonstrate our commitment to delivering a high-quality product and show that we value our users' experience. This builds trust and fosters loyalty among users, as they see that their feedback is acknowledged and acted upon. Satisfied users are more likely to recommend the product to others, further strengthening brand reputation and attracting new customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Growth.</strong> Fixing broken windows can have a positive impact on the overall success of a business. When users have a seamless and enjoyable experience, they are more likely to become repeat customers, leading to increased sales and revenue. Additionally, satisfied customers often serve as brand ambassadors, promoting the product through word-of-mouth and social media, contributing to organic growth and expanding the customer base.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fixing Broken Windows at Kumu</h3>
            <p>Last year, Kumu's Product Design team focused on fixing broken windows. Below are some we fixed:</p>

            <div class="case-study-item">
                <h4>Navigation Icons</h4>
                <div class="comparison-grid">
                    <div>
                        <p><strong>BEFORE:</strong> Customer support and usability testing revealed that users were unfamiliar with our menu icons and relied on trial and error to find the desired content.</p>
                        <img src="../images/fixing-broken-windows/image_03.png" alt="Before: Navigation Icons">
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p><strong>AFTER:</strong> Persistently showing menu items' labels enabled a more understandable “navigation” experience.</p>
                        <img src="../images/fixing-broken-windows/image_04.png" alt="After: Navigation Icons">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-item">
                <h4>Contrast & Legibility</h4>
                <div class="comparison-grid">
                    <div>
                        <p><strong>BEFORE:</strong> Users had difficulty reading low-contrast text. They also confused unselected toggles for disabled toggles because the grays were too light.</p>
                        <img src="../images/fixing-broken-windows/image_05.png" alt="Before: Low contrast text">
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p><strong>AFTER:</strong> We removed tiny, low-contrast text and went from light grays to darker ones (for both font and toggles). These went a long way toward legibility and usability.</p>
                        <img src="../images/fixing-broken-windows/image_06.png" alt="After: Improved contrast">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-item">
                <h4>Notifications</h4>
                <div class="comparison-grid">
                    <div>
                        <p><strong>BEFORE:</strong> Users frequently complained that Kumu's notifications were spammy. Configuring their Notification Settings was possible but the feature was buried deep under Profile Settings.</p>
                        <img src="../images/fixing-broken-windows/image_07.png" alt="Before: Buried notification settings">
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p><strong>AFTER:</strong> By adding an access point to Notifications Settings at the top-right of the Notifications page, notification preferences was always just a tap away.</p>
                        <img src="../images/fixing-broken-windows/image_08.png" alt="After: Accessible notification settings">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>... and many more examples of consistent iconography, button styles, preventing accidental actions, and better contrast.</p>
            
            <p>Incremental improvements are key to success in product development. By recognizing that addressing broken windows with these quick wins can yield significant results, we can enhance user satisfaction, improve usability, boost engagement, and enhance trust and loyalty.</p>
            
            <p>Getting into the habit of constantly fixing broken windows can improve your brand, set you apart from competitors, and show users that you listen to them and that they can trust you. Most importantly, it helps improve your product and the lives of your users.</p>

            <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Small inefficiencies or inconveniences almost always go unreported. Users just get accustomed to it—a sort of "learned helplessness". So, relying exclusively on user feedback or customer tickets is not always helpful. Identifying these small inconveniences will require a deeper understanding of user behaviors and habits.</li>
                <li>Making things accessible is difficult. It requires a lot of attention and resources—which may not always be available to small teams.</li>
                <li>Design changes like these often seem like vanity work. Getting them prioritized in the team's backlog is often hard work—requiring constant communication and collaboration with product and engineering stakeholders.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
          In 1982, James Wilson and George Kelling wrote about an idea that
          later became known as the Broken Window Theory. This theory suggests
          that visible signs of disorder, such as broken windows in a
          neighborhood, can contribute to an increase in crime and a decline in
          community well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          The theory says that if a broken window isn't fixed in a building, it
          shows that nobody cares about that place. This can make people think
          the area is neglected and lacks control, which makes it easier for
          serious crimes and bad behavior to happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, that if communities take care of small signs of disorder and fix
          broken windows, graffiti, or other signs of neglect quickly, they can
          make things more orderly and in control. This can stop bad behavior
          and make people feel safer and better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like disorder in a neighborhood is bad, ignoring small problems
          in a digital product can convey a sense of neglect, contribute to a
          negative perception of the product, and make the user experience
          worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          In UX, we can think of these as small usability issues — elements that
          make the user experience less smooth or confusing. Things like unclear
          buttons, broken links, or inconsistent design elements.

        <h3>The Power of Fixing Broken Windows</h3>
        <p>
          Fixing these broken windows has remarkable potential in product
          development:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User Satisfaction.</strong> Even small inefficiencies can
            compound frustration for users who perform repetitive actions daily.
            Fixing these seemingly insignificant issues is powerful, often more
            so than creating new features. By addressing user feedback and
            making quick wins to improve the user interface or usability, we can
            significantly enhance customer satisfaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improved Usability.</strong> Fixing broken windows leads to
            an improved user experience by enhancing the usability of a product.
            When we address minor issues, such as confusing buttons or unclear
            instructions, we make the product easier and more intuitive to use.
            This, in turn, reduces user frustration and increases their
            confidence in navigating the product.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Increased Engagement.</strong> When users encounter fewer
            obstacles and frustrations in using a product, they are more likely
            to engage with it. By optimizing the user experience, we can
            encourage users to spend more time interacting with the product,
            exploring its features, and achieving their goals. Increased
            engagement can lead to higher user retention and improved business
            outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enhanced Trust and Loyalty.</strong> By promptly fixing
            broken windows, we demonstrate our commitment to delivering a
            high-quality product and show that we value our users' experience.
            This builds trust and fosters loyalty among users, as they see that
            their feedback is acknowledged and acted upon. Satisfied users are
            more likely to recommend the product to others, further
            strengthening brand reputation and attracting new customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business Growth.</strong> Fixing broken windows can have a
            positive impact on the overall success of a business. When users
            have a seamless and enjoyable experience, they are more likely to
            become repeat customers, leading to increased sales and revenue.
            Additionally, satisfied customers often serve as brand ambassadors,
            promoting the product through word-of-mouth and social media,
            contributing to organic growth and expanding the customer base.

        <h3>Fixing Broken Windows at Kumu</h3>
        <p>
          Last year, Kumu's Product Design team focused on fixing broken
          windows. Below are some we fixed:
        </p>

        <div class="case-study-item">
          <h4>Navigation Icons</h4>
          <div class="comparison-grid">
            <div>
              <img

                alt="Before: Navigation Icons"
              />
              <h6>Before</h6>
              <p>
                Customer support and usability testing revealed that users were
                unfamiliar with our menu icons and relied on trial and error to
                find the desired content.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img
                src="../images/fixing-broken-windows/image_04.png"
                alt="After: Navigation Icons"
              />
              <h6>After</h6>
              <p>
                Persistently showing menu items' labels enabled a more
                understandable “navigation” experience.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-item">
          <h4>Contrast & Legibility</h4>
          <div class="comparison-grid">
            <div>
              <img
                src="../images/fixing-broken-windows/image_05.png"
                alt="Before: Low contrast text"
              />
              <h6>Before</h6>
              <p>
                Users had difficulty reading low-contrast text. They also
                confused unselected toggles for disabled toggles because the
                grays were too light.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img

              />
              <h6>After</h6>
              <p>
                We removed tiny, low-contrast text and went from light grays to
                darker ones (for both font and toggles). These went a long way
                toward legibility and usability.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

              />
              <h6>Before</h6>
              <p>
                Users frequently complained that Kumu's notifications were
                spammy. Configuring their Notification Settings was possible but
                the feature was buried deep under Profile Settings.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img

              <h6>After</h6>
              <p>
                By adding an access point to Notifications Settings at the
                top-right of the Notifications page, notification preferences
                was always just a tap away.
              </p>

              <h6>Before</h6>
              <p>
                When scrolling through the feed, users saw large, white margins
                in video posts and had to tap on the videos to watch them.
              </p>
            </div>

              <h6>After</h6>
              <p>
                Videos were resized to fill the screen's width, and configured
                to auto-play when it scrolled into view.
              </p>

              <h6>Before</h6>
              <p>
                Kumu used different icon styles across its interface. This
                created an inconsistent experience, degrading brand perception.

              <h6>After</h6>
              <p>
                Icons were redrawn in a consistent style. Guidelines
                standardized when to use an outline icon (unselected states) vs
                a filled icon (selected states). Even updating just the most
                visible icons—navigation icons—was a big improvement. (An 80/20
                effort.)

                separated. Users were given two options to close a stream but
                both needed two taps to perform: (1) tap Minimize and tap Close
                and (2) tap kebab and tap Close livestream.

                Kumu's livestream interface had the Like and the Gift actions
                beside each other which frequently caused users to accidentally
                send a gift (which cost money) when they were just spamming the
                livestream with likes.

                Icon buttons were increased in size for better usability and
                were updated to align with the new designs. The Like button was
                removed and replaced with the ability to double-tap anywhere on
                the screen to "like" the livestream.

              <h6>Before</h6>
              <p>
                Kumu's user interface featured gradients based on its brand
                colors. These gradients often provided poor contrast when used
                as background to a white font.

              <p>
                We removed gradients from the interface and used solid, brand
                colors that provided good contrast. We used larger buttons to
                improve usability as well.

                The Wallet screen was the only screen in our whole app that used
                dark mode—no one knew why. It felt very inconsistent with the
                whole experience. The copy also used brand colors which
                contrasted poorly against the dark interface.

                Dark mode was removed from the Wallet. Solid brand colors were
                used instead of gradients. Brand colors were also not used in
                the copy, prioritizing color contrast and readability.

          Incremental improvements are key to success in product development. By
          recognizing that addressing broken windows with these quick wins can
          yield significant results, we can enhance user satisfaction, improve
          usability, boost engagement, and enhance trust and loyalty.

        <p>
          Getting into the habit of constantly fixing broken windows can improve
          your brand, set you apart from competitors, and show users that you
          listen to them and that they can trust you. Most importantly, it helps

        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
        <ul class="key-learning-list">
          <li>
            Small inefficiencies or inconveniences almost always go unreported.
            Users just get accustomed to it—a sort of "learned helplessness".
            So, relying exclusively on user feedback or customer tickets is not
            always helpful. Identifying these small inconveniences will require
            a deeper understanding of user behaviors and habits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Making things accessible is difficult. It requires a lot of
            attention and resources—which may not always be available to small
            teams.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design changes like these often seem like vanity work. Getting them
            prioritized in the team's backlog is often hard work—requiring
            constant communication and collaboration with product and
            engineering stakeholders.

        <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
        <p>At the time, Kalibrr's business model was that companies had to pay to "unlock" a job applicant's contact information. And because the contact information was paid for, it was critical that the applicant respond or show up to the interview, otherwise the paid-for contact information was worthless.</p>

        <p> Clients began reporting that there was an increasing number of job applicants—whose contact information they've "bought"—that were not responding or showing up to interviews.</p>

        <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
        <p>How might we decrease incidents of jobseekers not showing up to scheduled interviews?</p>

        <div>
          <h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>
          <strong>Duration: </strong>4 months
          <br>
          <strong>Research: </strong>User feedback, user interview
          <br>
          <strong>Prototyping: </strong>Sketch mockups + Invision prototype
          <br>
          <strong>Testing: </strong>In-person usability testing, iteration w/ stakeholders
          <br>
          <strong>Strategy: </strong>Product strategy
          <br>
          <strong>Visuals: </strong>Consistent with platform's visual design strategy
          <br>
        </div>
        <br>

        <h4>RESULTS</h4>
        <p><strong>Successful launch, pioneered with Indonesia. Key feature to signing top Indonesian enterprises. Decreased overall reported no-show incidents in Indonesia and Philippines</strong></p>

        <h3>CASE STUDY</h3>
        <p>Face-to-face candidate interviews are still the norm and usually required here in the Philippines. And, No-Show candidates—candidates who don't show up to a scheduled interview—has been a problem historically for recruiters.</p>

        <p>In our research, we found that (1) recruiters frequently sent out interview invites and/or reminders via SMS and that (2) the scheduling process was more complicated for bigger companies who had multiple interviewers from other teams.</p>

        <p>Some of Kalibrr's more successful recruiters found that sending SMS or email reminders to candidates ahead of the interview increased the chances of those candidates showing up to their scheduled interviews. However, this was done manually and was time-consuming.</p>

        <p>By automating the sending of SMS and email, Kalibrr can save recruiters time and effort in crafting SMS invites or reminders. This was the purpose of the Interview Scheduler.</p>

        <p>Once both have agreed to a date and time, the scheduler automatically sent interview reminders to both jobseekers and interviewers. These reminders were sent several times before the scheduled interview: a week before (if the interview was scheduled more than a week ago), a day before of the interview, and on the day of the interview. This provided the candidate enough time to cancel if they had any reason to do so.</p>

        <p>These automations meant more time to do more important work for recruiters in smaller companies and a more streamlined and simplified scheduling process for recruiters and interviewers in bigger companies.</p>

        <p>Lastly, as a reactive effort to prevent No-Shows, the scheduler also allowed the recruiter to mark a candidate as a no-show if the candidate did not appear on the agreed schedule. This was reported back to Kalibrr who could flag the candidate for violating the code of conduct. And, in some occassions, refund the amount paid for the contact back to the company.</p>

        <p>Below are two mockups of the scheduler. The second shows a modal that schedules a candidate to an interview.</p>

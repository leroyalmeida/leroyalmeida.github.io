        <h1>Redesigning ING Philippines' Customer Service Experience</h1>
        <br><br>

        <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
        <p>ING's customer service is available 24/7, but customers sometimes still have to wait to get hold of an agent. And more often than not, these waiting times are unpleasant experiences for customers.</p>

        <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
        <p>We want our customer service to be a differentiating experience for customers.</p>

        <h4>WHAT I DID</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Competitive analysis, content analysis, information architecture mapping</li>
          <li>Ideation, strategy, and roadmap</li>
          <li>UX design and prototypes (Sketch, Figma)</li>
          <li>Usability testing (Figma)</li>
          <li>Manage and guide the collaboration efforts</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>RESULTS</h4>
        <p>Partial results already reveal a >50% decrease in empty chat sessions, reduction in time a customer waits to get support from an agent, and reduction in average handling time.</p>
        <p>Complete results after Solution #3 and #4 are implemented.</p>

        <h3>CASE STUDY</h3>

        <h4>JOBS-TO-BE-DONE</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Primary: When a user with an issue contacts support, I want to address their issue as fast as possible so that they can get back to doing whatever they need to get done.</li>
          <li>Secondary: When a user contacts the bank about an issue, I want the experience to be pleasant and seamless so that they feel that they are taken care of by ING.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>GUIDING PRINCIPLES</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Provide support as fast as possible</strong>: Customers should not be spending too much time waiting for an answer.</li>
          <li><strong>Provide correct and helpful answers the first time</strong>: We don't want customers repeatedly coming back for the same issue. As much as possible, we want to solve it the first time around.</li>
          <li><strong>Minimize the time it takes to provide a solution</strong>: We want to resolve the issue as fast as possible. If the issue has no true solution, we try to alleviate the customer's concern.</li>
          <li><strong>Drive activation, retention, and engagement metrics</strong>: Our solution should prove that it can impact the metrics that matter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>CURRENT ISSUES</h4>
        <h5><strong>Issue #1: FAQs are inaccessible</strong></h5>
        <p>When customers look for support, they don't immediately see the FAQ section because it isn't prominent. What's prominent are the two communication channels: Live Chat and Send a Message. (FAQs is the icon on the top right of the first screen below)</p>
        <img
            class="scale-with-gridpage-image"
            src="/images/ChatMessage.png"
            width="100%"
            height=""
            layout="responsive"
            alt="">
        </img>
        <br><br>
        <p>Some of our flows have an entry point to get help or support. But instead of redirecting to FAQ as a first option, we immediately point them towards talking to an agent.</p>

        <h5><strong>Issue #2: FAQ content and structure is not updated</strong></h5>
        <p>The content in the app's FAQ section was made by marketing. They made it in anticipation of what customer might ask and it hasn't been updated since the app was launched.</p>
        <p>The Help content in the app was also different from that in the website, because the website was more frequently updated by the Marketing team.</p>

        <h5><strong>Issue #3: Majority of questions being asked via chat were available in FAQ</strong></h5>
        <p>The current setup only allowed an agent to speak to one customer at a time.</p>
        <p>What we want is a setup where customers with urgent issues are prioritized and customers whose questions can be answered by the FAQs are provided those relevant FAQs.</p>

        <h5><strong>Issue #4: Current chat setup loses the whole conversation between customer and agent once the chat ends</strong></h5>
        <p>This issue produces a lot of extra work for customer agents. Because we lose the whole conversation, agents have to copy the entire transcript and save it as part of the customer's records.</p>
        <p>This seems easy to do for one customer, but imagine doing this for all the customers you interact with during the day. It gets pretty tedious, real quick.</p>

        <h5><strong>Issue #5: Chat required users to wait 5-10 minutes to get connected to an agent</strong></h5>
        <p>This is related to the issue above. Because a lot of customers are connecting to agents to ask simple questions and because agents can only attend to one customer at a time, customers had to wait a few minutes to get connected to an agent.</p>
        <p>"Waiting" was making sure that the app didn't close or time out. This meant that the user would be unproductive which added to the frustration of many users.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, even if they started narrating their issue while waiting, the agent receives the messages but cannot identify the sender because they weren't connected yet. This is what the agents called a "ghost chat".</p>
        <p>What we want is a setup users no longer have to "wait" to get connected to an agent and where they can continue sending messages that the agents will be able to read.</p>

        <h4>DISCOVERING SOLUTIONS</h4>
        <p>When discovering the possible solutions, we considered the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How effective is it against the jobs to be done we set?</li>
          <li>What's the level of change necessary to our existing product?</li>
          <li>What's the effort to build this?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There wasn't one solution that would solve all the issues we have. So we looked at several ways to fix those issues and those varied in terms of effort and difficulty:</p>
        <h5><strong>Make FAQs more accessible</strong></h5>
        <p>ING Philippines has no call centers. This meant that  all customer queries are currently resolved via chat and the FAQ. But the app's FAQs weren't as accessible as we wanted, so most customers just went straight to reaching out for human assistance. If possible and appropriate for the circumstances, we want customers to self-serve first.</p>

        <h5><strong>Update the FAQs</strong></h5>
        <p>In the ideal state, FAQs are able to answer a majority of customer inquiries, especially the common ones like how to open an account or what are there transactions fees.</p>

        <h5><strong>Add chat history</strong></h5>
        <p>Adding chat history allows agents to view past conversations in the same "thread". Being able to view past conversations quickly will decrease the average handling time for each customer.</p>
        <p>Adding chat history also removes the additional post-chat work that agents need to do. Post-chat work can take about an hour in total each day. This is time that could be better spent assisting more customers.</p>
        <p>This isn't as simple as it seemed as it involves changes to the tool that the agents use and the app that the customers use.</p>

        <h5><strong>Other solutions are still in-progress (Shhh 🤫)</strong></h5>
        <p>A few other solutions are still being built. These are the ones that requires a bit more effort. I'm excited to tell you about it so come back to this space to hear about those in a few weeks.</p>
        <br>

        <h4>DELIVERING THE SOLUTIONS</h4>
        <h5><strong>Solution #1: Making FAQs more accessible</strong></h5>
        <p>We redesigned the FAQs to be the first touchpoint for customers looking to get support. In this way, customers are encouraged to look for answers to their issues first before contacting support. This is aligned with our principle of providing support as fast as possible and minimizing the time to provide a solution.</p>
        <img
            class="scale-with-gridpage-image"
            src="/images/Help-Center.png"
            width="100%"
            height=""
            layout="responsive"
            alt="">
        </img>
        <br><br>
        <p>We also <strong>do not</strong> discourage customers from immediately reaching out to get support from agents. Because, while we want customers to self-serve first, we also recognize that there are occasions where FAQs are unhelpful. Most of these scenarios require human assistance. Like, reporting a fraud or blocking a card.</p>
        <p>In these kinds of "high-touchpoint" scenarios, customers should not be getting lost looking for the correct FAQ. They should be able to go straight to getting support from the right people.</p>

        <h5><strong>Solution #2: Improving Help content and structure</strong></h5>
        <p>We studied how different apps and digital banks structure their help sections. We looked at Grab, Citibank, Revolut, and a few other apps to see how they structured their Help content.</p>
        <p>We looked at our current state—what customers were frequently asking and what was currently on our website—and compared it to what we wanted the structure to be.</p>
        <p>Below is a very early analysis of the content.</p>
        <img
            class="scale-with-gridpage-image"
            src="/images/content-analysis.png"
            width="100%"
            height=""
            layout="responsive"
            alt="">
        </img>
        <br><br>

        <p>In updating the content and designing the information architecture, we kept several considerations in mind:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The new FAQs should accurately reflect what customers were inquiring about. Making the answers to these questions easily available may reduce the workload on customer support.</li>
          <li>The new FAQs should be usable by both the mobile app, the chatbot, and the website so that there is a single source of truth for all channels.</li>
          <li>The new information architecture should be flexible enough to accommodate future changes. For example, adding a new branch for FAQs for a new financial product or service.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This will be most likely outdated by the time you're reading it but this is the information architecture at its current state.</p>
        <img
            class="scale-with-gridpage-image"
            src="/images/IA-map.png"
            width="50%"
            height=""
            layout="responsive"
            alt="">
        </img>
        <br><br>

        <h5><strong>Solution #3: Adding chat history</strong></h5>
        <img
            class="scale-with-gridpage-image"
            src="/images/chat-history.png"
            width="100%"
            height=""
            layout="responsive"
            alt="">
        </img>
        <br><br>
        <p>The photo above shows an early exploration of what chat history might look like.</p>
        <p>Because we implemented other channels like "Send a Message"—for less urgent issues—most of the work with chat history was making sure that customers were able to find it. We validated this solution through usability tests.</p>
        <p>We also looked at solutions where the chat continues to be connected even if the customer goes outside of the chat. But this was deprioritized in favor of switching to asynchronous chat faster.</p>

        <h5><strong>Other solutions are still in-progress (Shhh 🤫)</strong></h5>

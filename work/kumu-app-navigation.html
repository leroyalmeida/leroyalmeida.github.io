          At the time, Kumu was the largest social entertainment app in the
          Philippines. It had +10 million users (82% Millennial and GenZ)
          visiting 60 million times per month. Our users average over an hour
          per day on the app, supporting thousands of income-earning Creators in
          50+ countries around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surveys ran by the UX research team showed that newly onboarded users
          downloaded the app because they saw it in social media ads and they
          heard it being recommended by Filipino celebrities. They heard that it
          was a livestreaming app but they didn’t understand yet what they could
          use it for. So, one of the challenges we’ve had has been onboarding
          new users and helping them experience the fun of making authentic
          connections in Kumu.

      <section class="section">
        <h2>What We Knew</h2>

        <h3>New users want to establish a mental model of the app</h3>
        <p>
          Looking at app reviews, we saw that “confusion” was a common sentiment
          from new users. And, based on research conducted by the UX research
          team, we also learned that new users felt the homepage was
          overwhelming. They would spend hours scrolling through the homepage
          and joining streams to try to understand how to use Kumu.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was supported by data too. We saw that one of the first behaviors
          new users did was to click around, explore the app, and try to get a
          feel of what Kumu is and what they could do here.
        </p>

        <div class="challenge-box">
          <blockquote>
            “Daming kailangan aralin pag new users. Pumapasok ako sa streams
            para matuto. Iniexplain lang niya kung paano gamitin. Masungit din
            siya so hindi ko po makausap ng maayos.”

        </div>

        <h3>Kumu's app information architecture was poor</h3>
        <p>
          Even though we provided new users with a quick onboarding tour, there
          was a lot of jargon left unexplained. When we talked to our users,
          these were some of the common sentiments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            (From the homepage) What does Following mean? What are Hot, New,
            Multi, Audio, and Teams? What do the icons in the bottom navigation
            mean?
          </li>
          <li>
            (From the side menu) What are Campaigns, Klips, Leaderboard, and
            Missions?
          </li>
          <li>
            (From the Profile menu) This isn’t what a Profile page in a social
            app usually looks like? Is the Missions here different from the one
            on the side menu? What about Campaigns and Leaderboard?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We learned that new users were overwhelmed with the variety of
          features they saw when exploring the app and this made it more
          difficult for them to understand and experience the value proposition.

        <h3>Notifications are a critical part of the Kumu experience</h3>
        <p>
          When we looked at the data, we saw that the Notifications page (which
          was still buried in the side menu) had increased usage after we
          released the “User Followed You” notification. From an average of X
          users per week, it quickly grew to Y users per week.
        </p>
        <p>
          We looked more into the data and saw that less than 25% of users
          clicked on the side menu. But, of those who clicked on the side menu,
          50% clicked Notifications, which had the highest click-thru rate among
          the menu items.
        </p>

        <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
        <p>
          We had been contemplating how to tackle rearranging our app’s
          navigation and improve users' mental model of the app for a few months
          now. Kumu's chief product officer, Crystal Widjaja, came up with a
          draft for the mobile app's new information architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the next few days, I came up with four other possible options. We
          essentially had a freeroll so, a few days later, Crystal made the call
          to go with one of the explorations.
        </p>

        <div class="case-study-item">
          <img
            src="../images/kumu-app-navigation/exploration-c.png"
            alt="Exploration C"
          />
          <p class="caption">
            Crystal made the judgement call and selected Exploration C
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="carousel-grid">
          <div class="case-study-item">
            <img
              src="../images/kumu-app-navigation/exploration-a.png"
              alt="Exploration A"
            />
            <p class="caption">Exploration A</p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-study-item">
            <img
              src="../images/kumu-app-navigation/exploration-b.png"
              alt="Exploration B"
            />
            <p class="caption">Exploration B</p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-study-item">
            <img
              src="../images/kumu-app-navigation/exploration-d.png"
              alt="Exploration D"
            />
            <p class="caption">Exploration D</p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-study-item">
            <img
              src="../images/kumu-app-navigation/exploration-e.png"
              alt="Exploration E"
            />
            <p class="caption">Exploration E</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Finally, Crystal selected "Exploration C". How did we know this was
          the right decision? At this point, it was an educated guess. The
          selected exploration seems to address the main challenges that we had:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong
              >New users try to establish a mental model of the app.</strong
            >
            Exploration C was a familiar layout, not too dissimilar from the
            information architecture of Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The information architecture of the app was poor.</strong>
            Exploration C consolidated a lot of the redundant entry points under
            the side menu.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Notifications are a key part of the current customer
              journey.</strong
            >
            Exploration C featured the entry point to Notifications in the main
            navigation.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <p>
          Since this was still an educated guess, our next step would be to test
          if the new information architecture solved our problems. And, because
          this was a massive change in navigation, we also wanted to know if the
          change might harm any working user flow that we have.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Will users know where to access their Profile?</li>
          <li>Will users know where to find their notifications?</li>
          <li>
            Will users know how to configure settings for their notifications?
          </li>
          <li>Will users know where to access My Watchlist?</li>
          <li>Will users know how to add their FB friends?</li>
          <li>Will users know how to share their profile link?</li>
          <li>Will users know how to scan their QR code?</li>
          <li>Will users know how to edit their addresses?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Usability Test Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Getting help from the UX research team, here’s a quick rundown of the
          completion rate of each task:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accessing Profile - 93.75% completion</li>
          <li>Accessing Notifications - 93.75% completion rate</li>
          <li>Accessing Notification Settings - 100% completion rate</li>
          <li>Accessing My Watchlist - 66.75% completion rate</li>
          <li>Adding FB friends - 81.25% completion rate</li>
          <li>Sharing profile link - 68.75% completion</li>
          <li>Scanning QR code - 87.5% completion rate</li>
          <li>Editing my address - 81.85% completion rate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Overall, participants shared they had a good experience with the new
          changes in the new navigation design app.

        <p>
          On July 1, we released the updated Side Menu, which consolidated
          feature entry points—including duplicates—from under the Side Menu and
          the Profile Menu. On July 20, we completed the switch and removed the
          old Profile Menu entry point in the main navigation—replacing it with
          Notifications.

            July-1 dip was when we consolidated more features in the Side Menu.
            July-20 increase was when we moved Notifications to the Main

              <strong>Design drives alignment and makes ideas concrete:</strong>
              With UX Research constrained by their backlog, tangible design
              explorations made abstract navigation problems concrete and

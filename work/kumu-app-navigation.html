          At the time, Kumu was the largest social entertainment app in the
          Philippines. It had +10 million users (82% Millennial and GenZ)
          visiting 60 million times per month. Our users average over an hour
          per day on the app, supporting thousands of income-earning Creators in
          50+ countries around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surveys run by the UX research team showed that newly onboarded users
          downloaded the app because they saw it in social media ads and they
          heard it being recommended by Filipino celebrities. They heard that it
          was a livestreaming app but they didn't understand yet what they could
          use it for. So, one of our challenges has been onboarding
          new users and helping them experience the fun of making authentic
          connections in Kumu.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Why this mattered for business</h3>
        <p>
          Confused new users meant lost revenue opportunities. Users who
          couldn't find key features like Wallet, Missions, or Notifications
          were less likely to engage with monetization touchpoints or build the
          habits that drive retention. With Kumu investing heavily in user
          acquisition through celebrity partnerships and social media ads, every
          churned user represented wasted marketing spend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our hypothesis: improving the information architecture would increase
          feature adoption and reduce new user churn by making the app's value
          proposition clearer from the first session.
        </p>

          New users want to establish a mental model of the app
        </h3>
        <p>
          Looking at app reviews, we saw that “confusion” was a common sentiment
          from new users. And, based on research conducted by the UX research
          team, we also learned that new users felt the homepage was
          overwhelming. They would spend hours scrolling through the homepage
          and joining streams to try to understand how to use Kumu.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was supported by data too. We saw that one of the first things
          new users did was click around, explore the app, and try to get a
          feel of what Kumu is and what they could do here.

          Screenshots above show what new users would’ve seen on the Homepage,
          the Side Menu, and the Profile Menu. Notice duplicate menu items like
          Campaigns, Missions, and Leaderboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though we provided new users with a quick onboarding tour, there
          was a lot of jargon left unexplained. When we talked to our users,
          these were some of the common sentiments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            (From the homepage) What does Following mean? What are Hot, New,
            Multi, Audio, and Teams? What do the icons in the bottom navigation
            mean?
          </li>
          <li>
            (From the side menu) What are Campaigns, Klips, Leaderboard, and
            Missions?
          </li>
          <li>
            (From the Profile menu) This isn’t what a Profile page in a social
            app usually looks like? Is the Missions here different from the one
            on the side menu? What about Campaigns and Leaderboard?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We learned that new users were overwhelmed with the variety of
          features they saw when exploring the app and this made it more
          difficult for them to understand and experience the value proposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our hypothesis was that, to make the app easier to understand for new
          users, we needed to improve core navigation and steer users toward key
          jobs-to-be-done.

          Notifications are a critical part of the Kumu experience

        <p>
          When we looked at the data, we saw that the Notifications page (which
          was still buried in the side menu) had increased usage after we
          released the “User Followed You” notification.

        <p>
          We looked more into the data and saw that less than 25% of users
          clicked on the side menu. But, of those who clicked on the side menu,
          50% clicked Notifications, which had the highest click-thru rate among
          the menu items.

        <h2>Exploring solutions</h2>
        <p>
          We had been contemplating how to tackle rearranging the app's
          navigation for a few months. Kumu's Chief Product Officer came up with
          an initial draft for a new information architecture. Over the next few
          days, I developed four additional explorations to give us options to
          evaluate.

        <p>
          I evaluated each exploration against three criteria based on our
          research findings: familiarity (does it use patterns users already
          know?), simplification (does it reduce redundant entry points?), and
          feature elevation (does it surface Notifications prominently?).

          Based on this analysis, I recommended Exploration C. It scored highest
          across all three criteria: it mirrored the information architecture of
          apps like Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn that our users already
          understood; it consolidated redundant entry points under a cleaner
          side menu; and it gave Notifications a prominent spot in the main
          navigation. This aligned with the CPO's strategic direction, and we
          decided to move forward with validation testing.

          Since this was still an educated guess, our next step would be to test
          if the new information architecture solved our problems. And, because
          this was a massive change in navigation, we also wanted to know if the
          change might harm existing user flows.

        <h3 class="section-title">Addressing lower completion rates</h3>
        <p>
          Two tasks showed lower completion rates: Accessing My Watchlist
          (66.75%) and Sharing profile link (68.75%). I assessed these results
          against our core objectives and determined they were acceptable risks
          for launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watchlist was a secondary feature primarily used by power users who
          would adapt to the new location. Profile link sharing was an edge case
          that didn't impact the core navigation goals of reducing confusion and
          elevating Notifications. The primary flows (accessing Profile at
          93.75%, Notifications at 93.75%, and Notification Settings at 100%)
          all exceeded
          our success threshold, validating that the redesign achieved its main
          objectives.
        </p>

        <p>
          On July 1, we released the updated Side Menu, which consolidated
          feature entry points (including duplicates) from under the Side Menu and
          the Profile Menu. On July 20, we completed the switch and removed the
          old Profile Menu entry point in the main navigation, replacing it with
          Notifications.

          <ul class="key-learning-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Moving forward under ambiguity:</strong> We didn't have
              perfect data on user navigation patterns, but the cost of inaction
              was higher than the cost of testing a well-reasoned hypothesis.
              Usability testing validated our approach with 93%+ completion on
              core tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Design as a research tool:</strong> With UX Research
              constrained by their backlog, I used tangible design explorations
              to make abstract navigation problems concrete. This generated
              stakeholder alignment faster than waiting for comprehensive
              research and gave us artifacts to test against.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Behavioral data over stated preferences:</strong>
              Analytics revealed Notifications' importance even though users
              didn't explicitly ask for it. The 50% click-through rate from the
              side menu signaled latent demand we could unlock through better
              placement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Strategic prioritization in testing:</strong> Not every
              task needed 90%+ completion. Accepting lower rates on secondary
              features (Watchlist, profile sharing) let us ship confidently
              while protecting the core navigation improvements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phased rollout as risk management:</strong> Releasing the
              side menu consolidation two weeks before the navigation bar change
              let us isolate variables and build confidence before the
              higher-stakes update.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Knowing when to ship:</strong> With more time, I would
              have explored improving Watchlist discoverability. But the core
              navigation wins were substantial enough to justify shipping, and
              waiting for perfection would have delayed value for millions of
              users.

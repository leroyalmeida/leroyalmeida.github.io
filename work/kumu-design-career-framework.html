          The design team at Kumu uses a dual-track growth framework. This
          allows designers to evolve in two directions—as individual
          contributors (ICs) or as managers.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the lead level—before deciding to continue as an IC or switch to
          being a manager—designers will be hybrids or player-coaches.
          Player-coaches are exactly that—sometimes players, sometimes coaches.
          They straddle the line, experiencing both tracks, helping them decide
          which path fits them best.

          of which has 2-4 different skills and different milestones you can
          reach.

        <h2>Hitting Milestones Using the 5C Rule</h2>
        <p>
          As you go deeper or take on more responsibilities, you cross a
          milestone. But, you don't achieve competency the first time you
          demonstrate relevant behaviors or tasks. In general, you must have
          demonstrated a "Conscious, Comfortable, Continuous, Consistent
          Competency" defined as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Conscious:</strong> having devoted intentional effort to
            this endeavor,
          </li>
          <li><strong>Comfortable:</strong> without being overly stretched,</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous:</strong> for a reasonable period of time,</li>
          <li><strong>Consistent:</strong> reliably and evenly,</li>
          <li><strong>Competency:</strong> meeting the criteria.</li>

        <h2>Nurturing Different Designer Shapes and Sizes</h2>
        <p>
          We've always looked for multi-faceted, T-shaped individuals, who bring
          a lot to the table other than just their craft. But, having a rigid
          ladder and making them tick milestones from a checklist hampers these
          individuals’ growth and limits their shapes. People produce great work
          when they are at their natural best.
        </p>
        <p>
          To nurture and accelerate the growth of the designers on the team,
          they are given the flexibility to identify which themes align with
          their personal journeys and which ones to focus on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having designers of different shapes helps form a more well-rounded
          team.

        <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Chapter One: What Is Strategy?</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Strategy is about making specific choices to win in the marketplace.</span></div></li><li><div>According to Mike Porter, author of Competitive Strategy, perhaps the most widely respected book on strategy ever written, a firm creates a sustainable competitive advantage over its rivals by “deliberately choosing a different set of activities to deliver unique value.”</div></li><li><div>Strategy therefore requires making explicit choices—to do some things and not others—and building a business around those choices.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Strategy is choice.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Strategy is an integrated set of choices that uniquely positions the firm in its industry so as to create sustainable advantage and superior value relative to the competition.</span></div></li><li><div>Many leaders tend to approach strategy in one of the following ineffective ways:</div></li><ul><li><div>They define strategy as a vision. Mission and vision statements are elements of strategy, but they aren’t enough. They offer no guide to productive action and no explicit road map to the desired future. They don’t include choices about what businesses to be in and not to be in. There’s no focus on sustainable competitive advantage or the building blocks of value creation.</div></li><li><div>They define strategy as a plan. Plans and tactics are also elements of strategy, but they aren’t enough either. A detailed plan that specifies what the firm will do (and when) does not imply that the things it will do add up to sustainable competitive advantage.</div></li><li><div>They deny that long-term (or even medium-term) strategy is possible. The world is changing so quickly, some leaders argue, that it’s impossible to think about strategy in advance and that, instead, a firm should respond to new threats and opportunities as they emerge.</div></li><ul><li><div>Unfortunately, such an approach places a company in a reactive mode, making it easy prey for more-strategic rivals. Not only is strategy possible in times of tumultuous change, but it can be a competitive advantage and a source of significant value creation.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>They define strategy as the optimization of the status quo. Many leaders try to optimize what they are already doing in their current business. This can create efficiency and drive some value. But it isn’t strategy. The optimization of current practices does not address the very real possibility that the firm could be exhausting its assets and resources by optimizing the wrong activities, while more-strategic competitors pass it by.</div></li><li><div>They define strategy as following best practices. Every industry has tools and practices that become widespread and generic. Some organizations define strategy as benchmarking against competition and then doing the same set of activities but more effectively. Sameness isn’t strategy. It is a recipe for mediocrity.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">But it is only through making and acting on choices that you can win. Yes, clear, tough choices force your hand and confine you to a path. But they also free you to focus on what matters.</span></div></li><li><div>Winning should be at the heart of any strategy. In our terms, a strategy is a coordinated and integrated set of five choices: a winning aspiration, where to play, how to win, core capabilities, and management systems.</div></li><li><div>Traditionally in the beauty industry, department store brands have taken the lead on innovation, developing new products and better products that, over time, trickle down to the mass market. Given P&amp;G’s greater scale, lower distribution costs, and considerable in-house R&amp;D capabilities, there was an opportunity to lead on innovation from the middle of the market. “We could flip this consumer paradigm that the best technology trickles down,” Drosos says. “We could have the best technology come from Olay.”</div></li><li><div>Independent tests, which showed Olay products performing as well as or better than department store brands costing hundreds of dollars more, helped reframe consumer perceptions of performance and value.</div></li><ul><li><div>Olay also needed to look the part. The packaging had to represent an aspiration, but also effectively deliver the product.</div></li><li><div>in skin care, there was the pervasive belief “that you get what you pay for. Women felt the products available in the mass-market channel were just not as good.”</div></li><li><div>Its pricing needed to hit the perfect note as well—not so high that mass consumers would be turned off, but not so low that prestige consumers would doubt its efficacy</div></li><ul><li><div>$12.99 was really good, $15.99 not so good, $18.99 great. We found that at $18.99,</div></li><li><div>At $18.99, it was a great value to a prestige shopper who was used to spending $30 or more. For the prestige shopper, it was great value, but not too cheap to be credible. And for the mass shopper, it signified that the product must be considerably better than anything else on the shelf to justify such a premium.</div></li></ul><li><div>But $15.99 was no-man’s-land—way too expensive for a mass shopper and really not credible enough for a prestige shopper.</div></li></ul><li><div>Strategy is the answer to these five interrelated questions:</div></li><ul><li><div>What is your winning aspiration? The purpose of your enterprise, its motivating aspiration.</div></li><li><div>Where will you play? A playing field where you can achieve that aspiration.</div></li><li><div>How will you win? The way you will win on the chosen playing field.</div></li><li><div>What capabilities must be in place? The set and configuration of capabilities required to win in the chosen way.</div></li><li><div>What management systems are required? The systems and measures that enable the capabilities and support the choices.</div></li></ul><li><div>In a small organization, there may well be a single choice cascade that defines the set of choices for the entire organization. But in larger companies, there are multiple levels of choices and interconnected cascades.</div></li><li><div>Each strategy influences and is influenced by the choices above and below it; company-level where-to-play choices, for instance, guide choices at the sector level, which in turn affect the category-level and brand-level choices. And the brand-level choices influence the category-level choices, which influence the sector- and company-level choices. The result is a set of nested cascades that cover the full organization</div></li><li><div>Consider a company that designs, manufactures, and sells yoga apparel. It aspires to create fierce brand advocates, to make a difference in the world, and to make money doing it. It chooses to play in its own retail stores, with athletic wear for women. It decides to win on the basis of performance and style. It creates yoga gear that is both technically superior (in terms of fit, flex, wear, moisture wicking, etc.) and utterly cool. It turns over its stock frequently to create a feeling of exclusivity and scarcity. It draws customers into the store with staff members who have deep expertise. It defines a number of capabilities essential to winning, like product and store design, customer service, and supply-chain expertise. It creates sourcing and design processes, training systems for staff, and logistics management systems.</div></li><li><div>Like the CEO, a salesperson must make the best choices she can under constraints and uncertainty. Her constraints came from the choices made above her in the organization, from the demands of her customers, and from the strategies of her competitors. For the CEO, the constraints came from the expectations of the capital markets, the company’s cash reserves, and the directions of the board of directors. Both the salesperson and her CEO are making strategic choices and acting upon them—the only difference is the scope of the choices and the precise nature of the constraints.</div></li><li><div>Winning Aspirations</div></li><ul><li><div>The first question—what is our winning aspiration?—sets the frame for all the other choices.</div></li><li><div>the abstract concept of winning should be translated into defined aspirations.</div></li><li><div>Aspirations are statements about the ideal future. At a later stage in the process, a company ties to those aspirations some specific benchmarks that measure progress toward them.</div></li><li><div>At Olay, the winning aspirations were defined as market share leadership in North America, $1 billion in sales, and a global share that put the brand among the market leaders.</div></li><li><div>Establish skin care as a strong pillar for beauty along with hair care.</div></li><li><div>Establishing and maintaining leadership of a new masstige segment, positioned between mass and prestige,</div></li><li><div>This set of aspirations served as a starting point to define where to play and how to win,</div></li><li><div>Clarity about the winning aspirations meant that actions at the brand, category, sector, and company level were directed at delivering against that ideal.</div></li><li><div>At the overall company level, winning was defined as delivering the most valuable, value-creating brands in every category and industry in which P&amp;G chose to compete (in other words, market leadership in all of P&amp;G’s categories). The aspiration was to create sustainable competitive advantage, superior value, and superior financial returns.</div></li><li><div>Aspirations can be refined and revised over time. However, aspirations shouldn’t change day to day; they exist to consistently align activities within the firm, so should be designed to last for some time.</div></li></ul><li><div>Where to Play</div></li><ul><li><div>The winning aspiration broadly defines the scope of the firm’s activities; where to play and how to win define the specific activities of the organization—what the firm will do, and where and how it will do this, to achieve its aspirations.</div></li><li><div>Where to play represents the set of choices that narrow the competitive field.</div></li><li><div>The questions to be asked focus on where the company will compete—in which markets, with which customers and consumers, in which channels, in which product categories, and at which vertical stage or stages of the industry in question.</div></li><li><div>No company can be all things to all people and still win,</div></li><li><div>Where to play choices:</div></li><ul><li><div>Demographic segments (men ages eighteen to twenty-four, midlife urbanites, working moms)</div></li><li><div>Geographies (local, national, international, developed world, economically fast-advancing countries like Brazil and China).</div></li><li><div>Compete in myriad services, product lines, and categories.</div></li><li><div>Participate in different channels (direct to consumer, online, mass merchandise, grocery, department store).</div></li><li><div>Participate in the upstream part of its industry, downstream, or be vertically integrated.</div></li></ul><li><div>Olay made two strategically decisive where-to-play choices: to create, with retail partners, a new masstige segment in mass discount stores, drugstores, and grocery stores to compete with prestige brands and to develop a new and growing point-of-entry consumer segment for anti-aging skin-care products.</div></li><li><div>P&amp;G’s company-level where-to-play choices and capabilities. P&amp;G tends to do well when the consumer is highly involved with the product category and cares a good deal about product experience and performance.</div></li><li><div>P&amp;G also does well with brands that can be sold through its best customers, retailers with which it has strong relationships and with which it can create significant shared value.</div></li><li><div>Corporately, when it came to where to play, the company needed to define which regions, categories, channels, and consumers would give P&amp;G a sustainable competitive advantage. The idea was to play in those areas where P&amp;G’s capabilities would be decisive and to avoid areas where they were not.</div></li><li><div>We wanted to play where P&amp;G’s core strengths would enable it to win.</div></li><ul><li><div>core brands, identifying a set of brands that were clear industry or category leaders and devoting resources to them disproportionately.</div></li><li><div>core geographies were. With ten countries representing 85 percent of profits, P&amp;G had to focus on winning in those countries.</div></li><li><div>where consumers expected P&amp;G brands and products to be sold, that is, mass merchandisers and discounters, drugstores, and grocery stores.</div></li></ul><li><div>Core became a theme in innovation</div></li><li><div>Determined the core technologies that were important across the businesses and focused on those technologies above all others.</div></li><li><div>Shift from a pure invention mind-set to one of strategic innovation; the goal was innovation that drove the core.</div></li><li><div>Focus on the consumer who matters most, targeting the most attractive consumer segments.</div></li><li><div>We were a company of premium-priced products, always going after product superiority. We tended to play, as a company, in the premium tiers in almost all categories." To compete in the developing world, Bergh says, a change in orientation was required: “We needed to begin broadening our portfolio and developing competitive propositions, including cost structures that would allow us to reach deeper into these emerging markets.</div></li><li><div>In sum, there were three critical where-to-play choices for P&amp;G at the corporate level:</div></li><ul><li><div>Grow in and from the core businesses, focusing on core consumer segments, channels, customers, geographies, brands, and product technologies.</div></li><li><div>Extend leadership in laundry and home care, and build to market leadership in the more demographically advantaged and structurlly attractive beauty and personal-care categories.</div></li><li><div>Expand to leadership in demographically advantaged emerging markets, prioritizing markets by their strategic importance to P&amp;G.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>How to Win</div></li><ul><li><div>Where to play selects the playing field; how to win defines the choices for winning on that field. It is the recipe for success in the chosen segments, categories, channels, geographies, and so on.</div></li><li><div>Remember, it is not how to win generally, but how to win within the chosen where-to-play domains.</div></li><li><div>The where-to-play and how-to-win choices should flow from and reinforce one another.</div></li><li><div>Where-to-play and how-to-win choices must be considered together, because no how-to-win is perfect, or even appropriate, for all where-to-play choices.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">To determine how to win, an organization must decide what will enable it to create unique value and sustainably deliver that value to customers in a way that is distinct from the firm’s competitors.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Competitive advantage—the specific way a firm utilizes its advantages to create superior value for a consumer or a customer and in turn, superior returns for the firm.</span></div></li><li><div>For Olay, the how-to-win choices were to formulate genuinely better skin-care products that could actually fight the signs of aging, to create a powerful marketing campaign that clearly articulated the brand promise (“Fight the Seven Signs of Aging”), and to establish a masstige channel, working with mass retailers to compete directly with prestige brands.</div></li><li><div>P&amp;G chose to compete from the core; to extend into home, beauty, health, and personal care; and to expand into emerging markets.</div></li><li><div>To be successful, how-to-win choices should be suited to the specific context of the firm in question and highly difficult for competitors to copy.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The key to making the right choices for your business is that they must be doable and decisive for you.</span></div></li><li><div>Bob Young, cofounder of Red Hat, Inc., knew precisely where he wanted his company to play: he wanted to serve corporate customers with open-source enterprise software.</div></li><li><div>At the time, the Linux market was highly fragmented, with no such clear leader. Young had to change the game—by literally giving his software away via free download—to achieve dominant market share and become credible to corporate information technology (IT) departments. In that case, Young decided where to play and how to win, and then built the rest of his strategy (earning revenue from service rather than software sales) around these two choices.</div></li></ul><li><div>Core Capabilities</div></li><ul><li><div>Two questions flow from and support the heart of strategy</div></li><ul><li><div>(1) what capabilities must be in place to win, and</div></li><li><div>(2) what management systems are required to support the strategic choices?</div></li></ul><li><div>The capabilities choice, relates to the range and quality of activities that will enable a company to win where it chooses to play.</div></li><li><div>Only a few capabilities are absolutely fundamental to winning in the places and manner that it has chosen:</div></li><ul><li><div>Deep consumer understanding.</div></li><ul><li><div>This is the ability to truly know shoppers and end users. The goal is to uncover the unarticulated needs of consumers, to know consumers better than any competitors do, and to see opportunities before they are obvious to others.</div></li></ul><li><div>Innovation.</div></li><ul><li><div>Innovation is P&amp;G’s lifeblood. P&amp;G seeks to translate deep understanding of consumer needs into new and continuously improved products.</div></li></ul><li><div>Brand building.</div></li><ul><li><div>By better defining and distilling a brand-building heuristic, P&amp;G can train and develop brand leaders and marketers in this discipline effectively and efficiently.</div></li></ul><li><div>Go-to-market ability.</div></li><ul><li><div>P&amp;G thrives on reaching its customers and consumers at the right time, in the right place, in the right way.</div></li></ul><li><div>Global scale. P&amp;G is a global, multicategory company. Rather than operate in distinct silos, its categories can increase the power of the whole by hiring together, learning together, buying together, researching and testing together, and going to market together.</div></li></ul><li><div>In isolation, each capability is strong, but insufficient to generate true competitive advantage over the long term. Rather, the way all of them work together and reinforce each other is what generates enduring advantage.</div></li></ul><li><div>Management Systems</div></li><ul><li><div>Systems that foster, support, and measure the strategy.</div></li><li><div>To be truly effective, they must be purposefully designed to support the choices and capabilities.</div></li><li><div>Systems need to ensure that choices are communicated to the whole company, employees are trained to deliver on choices and leverage capabilities, plans are made to invest in and sustain capabilities over time, and the efficacy of the choices and progress toward aspirations are measured.</div></li><li><div>Beneath Olay’s choices and capabilities, the team built supporting systems and measures</div></li><li><div>“Love the job you’re in” human resources strategy (to encourage personal development and deepen the talent pool in the beauty sector)</div></li><li><div>Detailed tracking systems to measure consumer responses to brand, package, product lines, and every other element of the marketing mix.</div></li><li><div>Organized around innovation, creating a structure wherein one team was working on the strategy and rollout of current products while another was designing the next generation.</div></li><li><div>At the corporate level, management systems included strategy dialogues, innovation-program reviews, brand-equity reviews, budget and operating plan discussions, and talent assessment development reviews.</div></li></ul><li><div>The Power of Choices</div></li><ul><li><div>Used deep consumer understanding to determine just where and how it could position Olay as an anti-aging powerhouse.</div></li><li><div>Leveraged scale and R&amp;D leadership to create a better product at a competitive price.</div></li><li><div>Strategy is an iterative process in which all of the moving parts influence one another and must be taken into account together.</div></li><li><div>A clear and powerful framework for thinking about choices is a helpful start for managers and other leaders intent on improving the strategy for their business or function.</div></li></ul><li><div>CHOICE CASCADE DOS AND DON’TS</div></li><ul><li><div>Do remember that strategy is about winning choices.</div></li><li><div>As you define your strategy, choose what you will do and what you will not do.</div></li><li><div>Do make your way through all five choices.</div></li><li><div>All five questions must be answered if you are to create a viable, actionable, and sustainable strategy.</div></li><li><div>Do think of strategy as an iterative process; as you uncover insights at one stage in the cascade, you may well need to revisit choices elsewhere in the cascade.</div></li><li><div>Do understand that strategy happens at multiple levels in the organization.</div></li><li><div>Do remember that there is no one perfect strategy; find the distinctive choices that work for you.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Chapter Two: What Is Winning</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Aspirations are the guiding purpose of an enterprise.</div></li><ul><li><div>Starbucks mission statement: “To inspire and nurture the human spirit—one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.”</div></li><li><div>Nike’s: “To bring inspiration and innovation to every athletein the world.” (The additional note, indicated by the asterisk, reads: “*If you have a body, you’re an athlete.”)</div></li><li><div>McDonald’s: “Be our customers’ favorite place and way to eat.”</div></li></ul><li><div>A statement of what the company seeks to be and a reflection of its reason to exist.</div></li><li><div>What does winning look like for this organization?

It is a recipe for mediocrity. Winning is what matters—and it is the ultimate criterion of a successful strategy.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Winning is worthwhile; a significant proportion (and often a disproportionate share) of industry value-creation accrues to the industry leader.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">When a company sets out to participate, rather than win, it will inevitably fail to make the tough choices and the significant investments that would make winning even a remote possibility.</span></div></li><li><div>Playing to Win</div></li><ul><li><div>It was clear that the deal would be good for the BPO partner, which would secure the biggest outsourcing deal in the industry’s history. But there was no obvious reason why the deal would help P&amp;G to win. P&amp;G wanted more than cost-effectiveness and a commitment to a predefined service level from an outsourcing deal.</div></li><li><div>Instead of signing one deal, P&amp;G would outsource various GBS activities to best-of-breed BPO partners, finding one ideal partner to manage facilities, another to manage IT infrastructure, and so on. The logic of this best-of-breed option was that P&amp;G’s needs are highly varied and that a variety of more specialized partners would be most capable of meeting the needs.</div></li><li><div>It played out in different ways. For HP, they were a distant fourth player in the industry. With P&amp;G, they gained instantaneous visibility and credibility. As important as they are to us, because all of our systems operate on the HP platform now, we are equally important to them [as their lead customer]. For each one of the [best-in-breed partners], the benefit was different, but each one of them became interdependent with P&amp;G.”5</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">What choice would help P&amp;G win? And how could that choice create sustainable competitive advantage?</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Whatever is distinctive and unique, we focus on; whatever is commodity, because there is not competitive advantage in doing it inside, we outsource.”</span></div></li><li><div>GBS competes for its internal customers.</div></li><ul><li><div>“We don’t mandate new services; we offer them [to businesses and functions] at a cost. If the business units like them, they will buy them. If they don’t like them, they will pass.”</div></li></ul><li><div>This open market provides important feedback and keeps GBS thinking about how to win with its internal customers and create new value.</div></li><li><div>Providing services wasn’t the strategy. Providing better services at higher quality and lower costs—while serving as an innovation engine for the company—was the strategy. It was a strategy aimed at winning.</div></li></ul><li><div>With Those Who Matter Most</div></li><li><div>It is therefore important to be thoughtful about the business you’re in, your customers, and your competitors.</div></li><li><div>The biggest danger of having a product lens is that it focuses you on the wrong things—on materials, engineering, and chemistry. It takes you away from the consumer. Winning aspirations should be crafted with the consumer explicitly in mind. The most powerful aspirations will always have the consumer, rather than the product, at the heart of them.</div></li><li><div>Against the Very Best</div></li><ul><li><div>“Who really is your best competitor? More importantly, what are they doing strategically and operationally that is better than you? Where and how do they outperform you? What could you learn from them and do differently?”</div></li></ul><li><div>WINNING ASPIRATION DOS AND DON’TS</div></li><ul><li><div>Do play to win, rather than simply to compete. Define winning in your context, painting a picture of a brilliant, successful future for the organization.</div></li><li><div>Do craft aspirations that will be meaningful and powerful to your employees and to your consumers; it isn’t about finding the perfect language or the consensus view, but is about connecting to a deeper idea of what the organization exists to do.</div></li><li><div>Do start with consumers, rather than products,</div></li><li><div>Do set winning aspirations (and make the other four choices) for internal functions and outward-facing brands and business lines.</div></li><li><div>Do think about winning relative to competition.

They wind up settling for average industry results at best.</div></li><li><div>To me, right meant that P&amp;G would focus on achievable ways to win with the consumers who mattered the most and against the very best competition. It meant leaders would make real strategic choices (identifying what they would do and not do, where they would play and not play, and how specifically they would create competitive advantage to win). And it meant that leaders at all levels of the company would become capable strategists as well as capable operators.</div></li><li><div>strategy is disciplined thinking that requires tough choices and is all about winning.</div></li><li><div>A strategy is a coordinated and integrated set of where-to-play, how-to-win, core capability, and management system choices that uniquely meet a consumer’s needs, thereby creating competitive advantage and superior value for a business.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Chapter Three: Where to Play</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Choosing where to play explicitly involved choosing where not to play as well,</div></li><li><div>Deep consumer understanding is at the heart of the strategy discussion.</div></li><li><div>To be effective, strategy must be rooted in a desire to meet user needs in a way that creates value for both the company and the consumer.</div></li><li><div>Who is the consumer? What is the job to be done? Why do consumers choose what they do, relative to the job to be done?</div></li><li><div>Pierce and his team made where-to-play choices on geography (North America), consumers (three segments in the top half of the market), products (paper towels, branded basic and premium), channels (grocery stores, mass discounters, drugstores, and membership club stores like Costco), and stages of production (R&amp;D and production of the paper towel itself, but not growing, harvesting, or pulping the trees).</div></li><li><div>The Importance of the Right Playing Field</div></li><ul><li><div>The choice of where to play defines the playing field for the company (or brand, or category, etc.). It is a question of what business you are really in. It is a choice about where to compete and where not to compete.</div></li><li><div>Where-to-play choices occur across a number of domains,</div></li><li><div>Geography. In what countries or regions will you seek to compete?</div></li><li><div>Product type. What kinds of products and services will you offer?</div></li><li><div>Consumer segment. What groups of consumers will you target? In which price tier? Meeting which consumer needs?</div></li><li><div>Distribution channel. How will you reach your customers? What channels will you use?</div></li><li><div>Vertical stage of production. In what stages of production will you engage? Where along the value chain? How broadly or narrowly?</div></li><li><div>A choice to serve everyone, everywhere—or to simply serve all comers—is a losing choice.</div></li><li><div>Choosing where to play is also about choosing where not to play.</div></li><li><div>The status quo—continuing on in the locations and segments you’ve always been—is all too often an implicit, unexamined choice. Simply because you have made a given where-to-play choice in the past is not a reason to stay there.</div></li><li><div>Inevitably, the significance of each dimension of the where-to-play choice will vary by context. Each dimension must be considered thoughtfully and will hold different weight in different situations.</div></li><li><div>We immerse ourselves in people’s day-to-day lives. We work hard to find the tensions that we can help resolve. From those tensions come insights that lead to big ideas.”2</div></li><li><div>a company should make its where-to-play choices with the competition firmly in mind. Choosing a playing field identical to a strong competitor’s can be a less attractive proposition than tacking away to compete in a different way, for different customers, or in different product lines.</div></li><li><div>A company may choose to play in a crowded field or in one with a dominant competitor if the company can bring new and distinctive value.</div></li><li><div>For Liquid Tide, it wasn’t a matter of avoiding a playing field that held a fierce competitor.

The second is how to win.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Winning means providing a better consumer and customer value equation than your competitors do, and providing it on a sustainable basis.</span></div></li><li><div>there are just two generic ways of doing so: cost leadership and differentiation</div></li><li><div>Low-Cost Strategies</div></li><ul><li><div>In cost leadership, as the name suggests, profit is driven by having a lower cost structure than competitors do.</div></li><li><div>The low-cost player doesn’t necessarily charge the lowest prices. Low-cost players have the option of underpricing competitors, but can also reinvest the margin differential in ways that create competitive advantage.</div></li><li><div>Mars has chosen to structure its range of candy bars such that they can be produced on a single super-high-speed production line. The company also utilizes less-expensive ingredients (by and large). Both of these choices greatly reduce product cost.</div></li><li><div>Rather than selling its bars at a lower price (which is nearly impossible because of the dynamics of the convenience-store trade), Mars has chosen to buy the best shelf space in the candy bar rack in every convenience store</div></li><li><div>Superior supply chain and distribution choices created a cost differential of approximately $300 per computer in Dell’s favor; it simply cost Dell’s competitors more to make, sell, and distribute personal computers. Rather than keeping all of that margin advantage, Dell returned some to consumers, underpricing its competitors for roughly equivalent products.</div></li><li><div>While all companies make efforts to control costs, there is only one low-cost player in any industry—the competitor with the very lowest costs.</div></li><li><div>Having lower costs than some but not all competitors can enable a firm to stick around and compete for a while. But it won’t win. Only the true low-cost player can win with a low-cost strategy.</div></li></ul><li><div>Differentiation Strategies</div></li><ul><li><div>In a successful differentiation strategy, the company offers products or services that are perceived to be distinctively more valuable to customers than are competitive offerings, and is able to do so with approximately the same cost structure that competitors use.</div></li><li><div>In this type of strategy, different offerings have different consumer value equations and different prices associated with them. Each brand or product offers a specific value proposition that appeals to a specific group of customers. Loyalty emerges where there is a match between what the brand distinctively offers and the consumer personally values.</div></li><li><div>The more a product is differentiated along a dimension consumers care about, the higher price premium it can demand.</div></li></ul><li><div>Both cost leadership and differentiation can provide to the company a greater margin between revenue and costs than competitors can match—thus producing a sustainable winning advantage</div></li><li><div>Though there are just two generic strategies, firms have many ways to employ them. In fact, in limited cases, firms can employ both strategies at the same time—driving a significant price premium over competitors and producing at a lower cost than those same competitors.</div></li><li><div>P&amp;G, in certain businesses like laundry detergents, feminine care, and fragrances, is a differentiator with cost advantages driven by market leadership and global scale.</div></li><li><div>In a cost leader, managers are forever looking to better understand the drivers of costs and are modifying their operations accordingly.</div></li><li><div>In a differentiator, managers are forever attempting to deepen their holistic understanding of customers to learn how to serve them more distinctively.</div></li><li><div>distinctively. In a cost leader, cost reduction is relentlessly pursued, while in a differentiator, the brand is relentlessly built.</div></li><li><div>At a cost leader, nonconforming customers—that is, customers who want something special and different from what the firm currently produces—are sacrificed to ensure standardization of the product or service, all in the pursuit of cost-effectiveness.</div></li><li><div>At a differentiator, customers are jealously guarded. If customers indicate a desire for something different, the firm tries to design a new offering that the customers will adore. And if a customer leaves, the departure drives a stake in the heart of the firm, indicating a failure of the strategy with that customer.</div></li><li><div>Both cost leadership and differentiation require the pursuit of distinctiveness. You don’t get to be a cost leader by producing your product or service exactly as your competitors do, and you don’t get to be a differentiator by trying to produce a product or service identical to your competitors’.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Competitive advantage provides the only protection a company can have. A company with a competitive advantage earns a greater margin between revenue and cost than other companies do for engaging in the same activity.</span></div></li><li><div>Many companies like to describe themselves as winning through operational effectiveness or customer intimacy. These sound like good ideas, but if they don’t translate into a genuinely lower cost structure or higher prices from customers, they aren’t really strategies worth having.</div></li><li><div>Multiple Ways to Win</div></li><ul><li><div>The notion is that the company in question finds the killer way to compete and generates such scale that the company can continue to press its advantage until it takes the entire market.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">There simply is no one perfect strategy that will last for all time. There are multiple ways to win in any almost any industry.</span></div></li><li><div>The question was how best to introduce this new technology in a way that would prove its effectiveness to consumers, build a strong, differentiated brand, and avoid the competitive walled cities</div></li><li><div>To have the best chance to win, the home-care team elected to start in P&amp;G’s home court, with laundry—positioning the new technology as a laundry additive that would attack odors. The team then attacked sequentially along the lines of least to more resistance: as a refresher for curtains, carpets, and upholstery around the home; as a deodorizer for other malodorous objects around the home, like running shoes and sports equipment; and finally as an air deodorizer and freshener.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Every line of business and function should have a strategy—one that aligns with the strategy of the company overall and decides where to play and how to win specifically for its context.</span></div></li><li><div>“Where to play and how to win has been a very important framework for us. Organizations are often goo at one or the other without realizing that they’re two different sets of decisions. At one point, we weren’t as disciplined about our where-to-play choices. It was everywhere anybody needed consumer insight or anywhere we thought it could add value. Just like a business dilutes its focus and in turn its growth potential when you try to do too many things at a time or do things that are further away from your core strengths, we were relatively diluted in the nature of the impact we could have.”4</div></li><li><div>“what kinds of company decisions or individual business decisions we are aiming to influence: those where consumer understanding is a key driver for company success. We made a clear where-to-play commitment to the company. Then we structured how to win, how to deliver against our where-to-play commitment,”</div></li><li><div>P&amp;G could have hired a leading research agency and outsourced everything. Instead, because consumer insights are so crucial to its how-to-win choices as a company, P&amp;G kept the intellectual capital in-house, where Lewis’s group designs new and customized test methods to suit specific needs, and outsources industry-standard research, like surveys and focus groups.</div></li></ul><li><div>Reinforcing Choices</div></li><ul><li><div>Where-to-play and how-to-win choices do not function independently; a strong where-to-play choice is only valuable if it is supported by a robust and actionable how-to-win choice. The two choices should reinforce one another to create a distinctive combination.</div></li><li><div>Traditionally, consumer goods companies have taken one of two approaches in such a situation. One is the trickle-down technology approach, basically taking a once cutting-edge but now largely obsolete product from the developed world and selling it in emerging markets. The other common approach is to take the existing premium product and strip out as many costs as possible.</div></li><li><div>“Keeping the consumer in mind. Let’s find out what those consumers actually need and build that diaper. You only build what they need; you don’t build all the bells and whistles that only consumers in developed markets expect.”</div></li></ul><li><div>Summing Up</div></li><ul><li><div>In choosing where to play, you must consider a series of important dimensions, like geographies, products, consumer needs, and so on, to find a smart playing field.</div></li><li><div>How-to-win choices determine what you will do on that playing field. Because contexts, like competitive dynamics and company capabilities, differ greatly, there is no single, simple taxonomy of how-to-win choices.</div></li><li><div>At a high level, the choice is whether to be the low-cost player or a differentiator. But the how of each strategy will differ by context.</div></li><li><div>Cost leaders can create advantage at many different points—sourcing, design, production, distribution, and so on. Differentiators can create a strong price premium on brand, on quality, on a particular kind of service, and so forth.</div></li><li><div>Action consistent with the how-to-win choice is vital. Cost leadership and differentiation have different imperatives that should lead to different sets of activities within a firm.</div></li><li><div>Where to play and how to win are not independent variables. The best strategies have mutually reinforcing choices at their heart.</div></li><li><div>What how-to-win choices make sense with which where-to-play choices? And which combination makes the most sense for your organization?</div></li></ul><li><div>HOW-TO-WIN DOS AND DON’TS</div></li><ul><li><div>Do work to create new how-to-win choices where none currently exist.</div></li><li><div>either. If, after lots of searching, you can’t create a credible how-to-win choice, find a new playing field or get out of the game.</div></li><li><div>Do consider how to win in concert with where to play. The choices should be mutually reinforcing, creating a strong strategic core for the company.</div></li><li><div>Don’t assume that the dynamics of an industry are set and immutable. The choices of the players within those industries may be creating the dynamics.</div></li><li><div>Don’t reserve questions of where to play and how to win for only customer-facing functions. Internal and support functions can and should be making these choices too.</div></li><li><div>Do set the rules of the game and play the game better if you’re winning. Change the rules of the game if you’re not.</div></li></ul><li><div>Pampers story is a great example of strategic insight and vision. A better product fulfilled an unmet consumer need, delivered a better user experience, and created better total consumer value.</div></li><li><div>In Peter Drucker’s terms, Pampers disposable baby diapers “created customers” and served them better than competitors did.</div></li><li><div>Determine whether a product innovation is really brand specific or ultimately category generic. Never give your current brand user a product-based reason to switch away. By denying Pampers the hourglass shape and better-fit features for a decade, the brand lost five generations of new parents and new babies.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Competition will follow your technology, trying to at least match it and ideally beat it. Technical superiority alone is not sustainable. </span></div></li><li><div>As John Pepper recounts in his book What Really Matters, the decisin not to invest in pull-ons in the late 1980s was made because P&amp;G was still under intense pressure to get its Ultra Pampers product upgrade execution right.b The company succumbed to the first-things-first argument and put every available resource on fixing the current problem. It did not balance returns from the present with investing in the future. Again, P&amp;G miscalculated on consumer preferences, over-weighted concerns about capital and price premium, and underestimated the competition.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Chapter Five: Play to Your Strengths</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Gillette was P&amp;G’s biggest value-creating acquisition</div></li><li><div>P&amp;G had three relevant criteria for any acquisition.</div></li><li><div>First, any acquisition had to be “growth accretive—in a market that was growing (and likely to continue growing) faster than the average in its space and in a category or segment, geography or channel where we thought that we could grow as fast as the market, if not faster.”3</div></li><li><div>Second, the acquisition had to be structurally attractive—a business “that tended to have gross and operating margins above the industry or company average. We were looking for businesses that could generate strong, free cash flow.”</div></li><li><div>Free cash flow was an important driver of value creation for P&amp;G corporately.</div></li><li><div>Final criterion—one that too few companies consider systematically: how the potential acquisition would fit with the company’s strategy—its winning aspiration, its choices about where to play and how to win, its capabilities, and its management systems.</div></li><li><div>‘What did P&amp;G bring to the party? How good of a fit are they with our sources of competitive advantage?’”</div></li><li><div>Gillette provided the leading male and female shaving brands and the leading toothbrush business in the world, all large enough to instantly become core businesses for P&amp;G.</div></li><li><div>Gillette also fit well with the strategic choice to grow in the beauty-care and personal-care categories.</div></li><li><div>Geographically, it offered complementary strengths in emerging markets, providing leadership positions in countries where P&amp;G was building presence (like Brazil, India, and Russia).</div></li><li><div>On how to win, Gillette’s brand-building expertise, product innovation, core technologies, and retail merchandising mastery aligned well with P&amp;G’s company-level choices.</div></li><li><div>“At the end of the day,” Daley continues, “it really comes down to, are you, as an acquirer, going to bring value to that acquisition or not? The acquisition is only really successful if you’re a better owner of the business than either the previous owner or the company as an independent company.</div></li><li><div>Are the capabilities and strengths that you’re bringing to the business going to improve it, grow it faster, and create more value than it did before?”</div></li><li><div>Gillette and the Strategic Choice Cascade</div></li><ul><li><div>“Unlike a lot of acquisitions, it wasn’t a successful company buying an unsuccessful company. It was a successful company buying a successful company.”4</div></li><li><div>It was a matter of leveraging Gillette and P&amp;G capabilities and selectively creating new ones where capabilities did not exist at the level required to win.</div></li><li><div>Five capabilities core to P&amp;G’s where-to-play and how-to-win choices are consumer understanding, brand building, innovation, go-to-market ability, and global scale. The notion of bringing these capabilities to bear on the Gillette business was top of mind.</div></li><li><div>Only in India did the scientist really begin to understand the needs of the Indian consumer. He learned what he could not learn inside his lab or from consumer testing outside London. Typically, razors are designed and tested with the assumption that everyone haves as people do in the West, with reliable access to a large sink and running hot water. In India, the team members saw that this simply wasn’t true. Many of the men they met shaved with only a small cup of cold water. Without hot running water to clean the razor, small hairs tend to clog the blade, making shaving far more difficult. Gillette’s new product would take that unique challenge into account. It would be a new kind of razor, custom-built to meet the needs of consumers in India.</div></li><li><div>For chief information officer Passerini, the capabilities required to make the Gillette acquisition a success looked a little different. For him and his team, the whole undertaking was in large part a systems-integration challenge. They had to integrate two massive businesses, with two very different IT systems, without missing a beat.</div></li><li><div>Passerini set about innovating his team structures, his partnership models, indeed his whole business, to take advantage of scale rather than be trapped by it.</div></li><li><div>Typically, in an acquisition, all the focus is on integration, on synergies, and on getting the right leadership in place. But synergy is not strategy.</div></li><li><div>Strategy mattered most.</div></li></ul><li><div>Understanding Capabilities and Activity Systems</div></li><ul><li><div>An organization’s core capabilities are those activities that, when performed at the highest level, enable the organization to bring its where-to-play and how-to-win choices to life.</div></li><li><div>Porter noted that powerful and sustainable competitive advantage is unlikely to arise from any one capability (e.g., having the best sales force in the industry or the best technology in the industry), but rather from a set of capabilities that both fit with one another (i.e., that don’t conflict with one another) and actually reinforce one another (i.e., that make each other stronger than they would be alone).</div></li><li><div>For Porter, a company’s “strategic position is contained in a set of tailored activities designed to deliver it.”9</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“Competitive strategy is about being different … [and] means deliberately choosing a different set of activities to deliver unique value,”</span></div></li><li><div>Activity system must also be distinctive from the activity systems of competitors.</div></li><li><div>Articulating a firm’s core capabilities is a vital step in the strategy process.</div></li><li><div>Identifying the capabilities required to deliver on the where-to-play and how-to-win choices crystallizes the area of focus and investment for the company. It enables a firm to continue to invest in its current capabilities, to build up others, and to reduce the investment in capabilities that are not essential to the strategy.</div></li><li><div>P&amp;G’s where-to-play choices were coming together (i.e., grow from the core; extend into home, beauty, health, and personal care; and expand into emerging markets), and its how-to-win choices were also becoming clear (i.e., excellence in consumer-focused brand building; innovative product design; and leveraging global scale and retailer partnerships)</div></li><li><div>Three votes on what constituted the core capabilities of the company, along the following criteria:</div></li><ul><li><div>First, for a given capability, the group had to be reasonably sure P&amp;G already had real, measurable competitive advantage in that area and could widen its margin of advantage in the future.</div></li><li><div>Second, the capability had to be broadly relevant and important to the majority of P&amp;G’s businesses.</div></li><li><div>Third, the capability had to be decisive, a real competitive advantage that was the difference between winning and losing.</div></li></ul><li><div>Ultimately, the question was, what capabilities must P&amp;G, as a global company, have to win across the industries in which it would compete?</div></li><li><div>When articulating core capabilities, you need to distinguish between generic strengths and critical, mutually reinforcing activities.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">A company needs to invest disproportionately in building the core capabilities that together produce competitive advantage.</span></div></li><li><div>Rather than starting with capabilities and looking for ways to win with those capabilities, you need to start with setting aspirations and determining where to play and how to win. Then, you can consider capabilities in light of those choices. Only in this way can you see what you should start doing, keep doing, and stop doing in order to win.</div></li><li><div>The five P&amp;G capabilities can be understood as forming the basis of P&amp;G’s company-level activity system.</div></li><ul><li><div>the core capabilities are shown as large nodes, and the links between the large nodes represent important reinforcing relationships.</div></li><li><div>reinforcing relationships make each capability stronger, which is an essential characteristic of an activity system: the system as a whole is stronger than any of the component capabilities, insofar as those capabilities fit with and reinforce one another.</div></li></ul><li><div>innovation must be consumer centered if it is to be meaningful and provide competitive advantage—so innovation requires a deep understanding of the needs of consumers. The goal is to connect consumer needs with what is technologically possible.</div></li><li><div>Subordinate nodes are the activities that support the core capabilities.</div></li><li><div>An activity system is of no value unless it supports a particular where-to-play and how-to-win choice.</div></li><li><div>Once you lay out such a system map, you can ask a sequential set of questions about feasibility, distinctiveness, and defensibility.</div></li><li><div>In addressing feasibility, ask several questions: is this a realistic activity system to build? How much of it is currently in place, and how much would you have to create? For the capabilities you would need to build, is it affordable to do so?</div></li><li><div>When you have a feasible activity system, you can ask more questions: is it distinctive? Is it similar to or different from competitors’ systems?</div></li><li><div>Imagine that a competitor has a different where-to-play and how-to-win choice, but a very similar set of capabilities and supporting activities. In such a situation, the competitor could shift to your potentially superior where-to-play and how-to-win choices and begin to cut in to your competitive advantage.</div></li><li><div>As Porter notes, not all of the elements need to be unique or impossible to replicate. It is the combination of capabilities, the activity system in its entirety, that must be inimitable.</div></li><li><div>When it has a feasible and distinctive activity system, you can ask, is the system defensible against competitive action? If the system can be readily replicated or overcome, then the overall strategy is not defensible and won’t provide meaningful competitive advantage.</div></li></ul><li><div>Capabilities Throughout the Organization</div></li><ul><li><div>Each unit must have an activity system that supports its choices, a system that is informed by the corporate-level map. In other words, layers of capabilities occur throughout the organization, and the activity systems look at least a little different in different parts of the company.</div></li><li><div>For a corporation to have a chance of delivering greater value together than the units could individually, there must be some core activities in common—both among businesses in the portfolio and between those businesses and the company overall. It is essential that all of the systems have at least some capabilities and activities that line up with the core capabilities of the organization.</div></li><li><div>The links between the systems are crucial to create brand, category, sector, function, and overall company competitive advantage—to make the system stronger than the sum of its parts.</div></li></ul><li><div>Multilevel Strategy</div></li><ul><li><div>Three principles to help the company put together integrated activity systems at multiple organizational levels.</div></li><ul><li><div>Start at the Indivisible Level</div></li><ul><li><div>(1) the activity system would look more or less the same down one level, but</div></li><li><div>(2) it looks meaningfully different up one organizational level.</div></li><li><div>The ground-level maps (e.g., Head &amp; Shoulders and Nice ’n Easy) can be thought of as indivisible activity systems: below this level, the activity system doesn’t divide into distinct maps, while above this level, multiple distinct maps are aggregated together into a unique system.</div></li><li><div>This indivisible level will not be the same in every organization (i.e., the indivisible activity system is not always found at the brand level).</div></li><li><div>Build activity systems starting at the ground level—the point of indivisible activity systems—and work your way up from there. Why? The capabilities at the indivisible level drive the ones above.</div></li></ul><li><div>Add Competitive Advantage to the Level Below</div></li><ul><li><div>All levels above the indivisible activity system are aggregations that must add net competitive advantage in some way. Since aggregation inevitably creates costs (financial and administrative) that wouldn’t exist if the indivisible activity systems existed as separate businesses, the strategy at all levels of aggregation must contribute a countervailing benefit to those below, somehow improving their competitiveness.</div></li><li><div>A level can contribute a net benefit in two ways—through two kinds of reinforcing rods.</div></li><li><div>First, it can provide the benefit of a shared activity.</div></li><li><div>The technology advantage that is enabled through shared activities can be powerful.</div></li><li><div>The second way a higher level of aggregation can provide value is through skills and knowledge transfer.</div></li><li><div>Management at the each level of aggregation should seek to develop an activity system that focuses as exclusively as possible on the key reinforcing rods through which that level has chosen to add value to the levels below it. The aggregator’s primary job is to help the level below compete more effectively through shared activities and transfer of skills.</div></li></ul><li><div>Expand or Prune the Portfolio Below to Enhance Competitiveness</div></li><ul><li><div>capabilities that run through and create advantage in the whole of your organization—and determine whether the portfolio can be expanded into other businesses that would benefit competitively from those reinforcing rods.</div></li><li><div>Equally important is pruning of the portfolio below when the benefits of the reinforcing rods cannot match the financial and administrative costs of aggregation. These are businesses that would be better off in another company’s portfolio or as independent operations.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><li><div>Supporting the Choices</div></li><ul><li><div>From the where-to-play and how-to-win choices follows the next question: what capabilities are required to deliver on that strategy?</div></li><li><div>An activity system captures the most important activities of the organization in a single visual representation.</div></li><li><div>The large nodes of the map are the core capabilities, while the smaller nodes are the activities that support those core capabilities.</div></li><li><div>The activity system should be feasible, distinctive, and defensible if it is to enable you to win.</div></li><li><div>By identifying the capabilities required to achieve competitive advantage, the firm can apply resources, attention, and time to the things that matter most.</div></li></ul><li><div>BUILDING CAPABILITIES DOS AND DON’TS</div></li><ul><li><div>Do discuss, debate, and refine your activity system;</div></li><li><div>Don’t obsess about whether something is a core capability or a supporting activity; try your best to capture the most important activities required to deliver on your where-to-play and how-to-win choices.</div></li><li><div>Don’t settle for a generic activity system; work to create a distinctive system that reflects the choices you’ve made.</div></li><li><div>Do keep the whole company in mind, looking for reinforcing rods that are strong and versatile enough to run through multiple layers of activity systems and keep the company aligned.</div></li><li><div>Do explicitly test for feasibility, distinctiveness, and defensibility. Assess the extent to which your activity system is doable, unique, and defendable in the face of competitive reaction.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Chapter Six: Manage What Matters</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Even if you set a winning aspiration, determine where to play and how to win, and define the capabilities required, strategy can still fail—spectacularly—if you fail to establish management systems that support those choices and capabilities.</div></li><li><div>To truly win in the marketplace, a company needs a robust process for creating, reviewing, and communicating about strategy; it needs structures to support its core capabilities; and it needs specific measures to ensure that the strategy is working.</div></li><li><div>Systems for Making and Reviewing Strategy</div></li><ul><li><div>A strategy discussion is not an idea review. A strategy discussion is not a budget or a forecast review. A strategy discussion is how we are going to accomplish our growth objectives in the next three to five years.</div></li><li><div>Whatever strategic issues the president wanted to discuss were delivered in writing in advance of the strategy review meeting.</div></li><li><div>The senior team would review the submission and select the issues it wished to discuss (or propose alternative points of discussion). A one-paragraph note (and never more than a one-page letter) would go back to the president, highlighting those issues for discussion. Some meetings focused on a single strategic question, and the team rarely tried to wrestle with more than three questions in a single meeting.</div></li><li><div>First, there would be no presentation, only a discussion of the strategic issues agreed on in advance.</div></li><li><div>Second, we limited the number of folks in the room, down from twenty-five to just four or five from the business plus the CEO and the corporate leaders who would bring specific experience or knowledge on the strategy issue.</div></li><li><div>Third, participants would not be allowed to bring more than three new pages of material to the meeting to share—we did not want the participants to race off and create yet another PowerPoint deck with answers to the questions raised in the letter. We genuinely wanted to have a conversation about the key strategic issues in the business.</div></li><li><div>These reviews focused on very basic, very fundamental questions with the intent of helping the team make better strategic choices.</div></li><li><div>We had three reasons for the shift in process.</div></li><ul><li><div>First, we wanted to shift the culture of the organization to one that was more dialogue oriented.</div></li><li><div>Second, we wanted to create a structure in which the business teams could truly benefit from the experience and cross-enterprise perspective of senior leaders.</div></li><li><div>And finally, we wanted to build the strategic-thinking capabilities of P&amp;G’s executives, asking them to practice thinking through strategic issues with others in real time.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>New Norms for Dialogue</div></li><ul><li><div>People’s default mode of communication tends to be advocacy—argumentation in favor or their own conclusions and theories, statements about the truth of their own point of view.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The kind of dialogue we wanted to foster is called assertive inquiry.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">This approach blends the explicit expression of your own thinking (advocacy) with a sincere exploration of the thinking of others (inquiry).</span></div></li><li><div>In other words, it means clearly articulating your own ideas and sharing the data and reasoning behind them, while genuinely inquiring into the thoughts and reasoning of your peers.</div></li><li><div>“I have a view worth hearing, but I may be missing something.”</div></li><li><div>If they might be missing something, the best way to explore that possibility is to understand not what others see, but what they do not.</div></li><li><div>Open dialogue and increase understanding through a balance of advocacy and inquiry.</div></li><li><div>This approach includes three key tools:</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Advocating your own position and then inviting responses</span> (e.g., “This is how I see the situation, and why; to what extent do you se it differently?”);</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Paraphrasing what you believe to be the other person’s view and inquiring as to the validity of your understanding</span> (e.g., “It sounds to me like your argument is this; to what extent does that capture your argument accurately?”); and</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Explaining a gap in your understanding of the other person’s views, and asking for more information</span> (e.g., “It sounds like you think this acquisition is a bad idea.

While it may feel more forceful to advocate, advocacy is actually a weaker move than balancing advocacy and inquiry.</div></li><li><div>Inquiry leads the other person to genuinely reflect and hear your advocacy rather than ignoring it and making their own advocacy in response.</div></li><li><div>The goal was to create a culture of inquiry that would surface productive tensions to inform smarter choices.</div></li><li><div>The explicit goal was to create strategists at all levels of the organization.</div></li><li><div>The idea is to build up strategy muscles over time, in different contexts, so that as managers rise in the organization, they are well prepared for the next strategic task.</div></li><li><div>Creating a truly robust strategy takes the capabilities, knowledge, and experience of a diverse team—a close-knit group of talented and driven individuals, each aware of how his or her own effort contributes to the success of the group and all dedicated to winning as a collective.</div></li><li><div>strategic choice is a judgment call in which nobody can prove that a particular strategy is right or the best in advance,</div></li><li><div>Everyone selects and interprets data about the world and comes to a unique conclusion about the best course of action.</div></li></ul><li><div>A Framing Structure</div></li><ul><li><div>The goal was to create in the OGSM a simple, clear expression of a strategy, a living document that everyone in the business knew and understood.</div></li><li><div>The OGSM became the foundation of all manner of discussions, effectively grounding capital allocation, branding, resourcing, and innovation strategies in where to play and how to win.</div></li></ul><li><div>Communicating the Strategy</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Strategy is formulated at all levels of the organization, and to be successful, it needs to be clearly communicated at all levels as well.</span></div></li><li><div>Ask, what are the critical strategic choices that everyone in the organization should know and understand?</div></li><li><div>it boiled down to three themes that would enable the company to win, in the places and ways it had chosen,</div></li><ul><li><div>The first dictum, that the consumer is boss, was a reorientation to the company’s aspiration—to improve the lives of consumers.</div></li><ul><li><div>We wanted everyone focused on the end consumer in all aspects of the business: in innovation, branding, go-to-market strategies, investment choices, and so on.</div></li></ul><li><div>The second crucial theme was to win the consumer value equation.</div></li><ul><li><div>the way that P&amp;G would win: by opening up a bigger gap between the value it offers to consumers and the cost of delivering that value than competitors’ gaps.</div></li><li><div>providing unique value to consumers (through brand differentiation and innovative products).</div></li><li><div>maintaining a cost position that would let P&amp;G offer that value to the consumer at an attractive price and still make a healthy profit.</div></li></ul><li><div>The third and final message was the vital importance of winning the two most important moments of truth.</div></li><ul><li><div>The notion behind moments of truth is that a company’s performance is the sum total of all its interactions with its consumers, the moments in which the brand promise is either realized or not in the consumer’s mind.</div></li><li><div>It is when the product experience reinforces the brand promise and helps start a first-time purchaser down the path toward repurchase, regular usage, and, ultimately, brand loyalty.</div></li><li><div>The notion that there are two crucial moments of truth—when the consumer encounters the product in the store for the first time and when he or she first uses at home—was significant for P&amp;G. Previously, the whole company had focused primarily on that second moment—the at-home, in-use moment.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">In any organization, the choices at the top must be precisely and evocatively stated, so that they are easily understood. Only when the choices are clear and simple can they be acted upon—only then can they effectively shape choices throughout the rest of the organization.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Systems to Support Core Capabilities</div></li><ul><li><div>The capabilities, which are captured in the fourth box of the choice cascade, are so important to competitive advantage that a company needs to install systems to ensure that these capabilities are properly nurtured. The challenge is to determine what kinds of systems are needed and how best to create them.</div></li><li><div>On consumer understanding, P&amp;G invested aggressively in new consumer-research methodologies,</div></li><li><div>P&amp;G invested significantly in innovation—in understanding the innovation process, in exploring disruptive innovation with Clay Christensen and Innosight,</div></li><li><div>P&amp;G formalized its brand-building framework and set out to create new brands that would improve the lives of consumers.</div></li><li><div>On the go-to-market front, P&amp;G invested heavily in strategic partnerships with retailers.</div></li><li><div>P&amp;G invested significantly in scope and scale, articulating the ways in which the advantages they confer are more about learning curves and re-applicability than about size.</div></li><li><div>“Are you capturing that value, both in terms of your activity systems and in terms of your economics? We historically weren’t. If you go way back, we were really operating as individual countries. We then made an important move to go to global categories.”</div></li><li><div>to put together some modeling on what benefit we should see from category scale, company scale, country scale, so that we could hold ourselves accountable to a standard of overhead efficiency that was truly reflective of our scale.” Because scale was a critical core competency, it was necessary to build supporting systems and to measure it in meaningful, impactful ways.</div></li><li><div>“It’s not enough to build scale for a brand or category,” Moeller observes. “You have to integrate that into the company. The processe that you put in place to do that, they have to be very deliberate. It doesn’t happen by itself. What happens [naturally] is entropy. You have to leverage scale in a way that doesn’t disable entrepreneurialism, business ownership. It’s integrative. It’s not centralized. Centralized is a very different thing. This scale work is bringing the leaders of the businesses to work together towards a plan that not only optimizes the company, but in its best form, optimizes their category as well.</div></li><li><div>We encouraged the design of systems in support of P&amp;G’s company capabilities, which were leveraged across all levels of the organization. But we also encouraged categories and brands to build systems to support the winning capabilities that were unique to their industry.</div></li></ul><li><div>Measurement of Desired Outcomes</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">If aspirations are to be achieved, capabilities developed, and management systems created, progress needs to be measured.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Measurement provides focus and feedback.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Focus comes from an awareness that outcomes will be examined, and success or failure noted, creating a personal incentive to perform well.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Feedback comes from the fact that measurement allows the comparison of expected outcomes with actual outcomes and enables you to adjust strategic choices accordingly.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>For measures to be effective, it is crucial to indicate in advance what the expected outcomes are.</div></li><li><div>Measures can and should be developed throughout the organization.</div></li><li><div>Our weighted purchase intent (WPI) measure looked at a number of product dimensions that included things like the aesthetic appeal, the design, the feel of the diaper, the look of the diaper in addition to technical performance; it also considered the brand proposition you were giving to the consumer and the price of the product.”</div></li><li><div>understand all the components of the consumer value equation: the drivers of consumer preference and the overall perceptions of product and brand value.</div></li></ul><li><div>Shifting Gears</div></li><ul><li><div>Building management systems takes time, money, and focus. There is no one-size-fits-all set of systems; they need to be geared to individual context and capabilities.</div></li><li><div>Until a set of systems and measures is in place, the strategic choice cascade is incomplete and your strategy job is not done (not that it is ever truly done!).</div></li></ul><li><div>MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND MEASURES DOS AND DON’TS</div></li><ul><li><div>Don’t stop at capabilities; ask yourself which management systems are needed to foster those capabilities.</div></li><li><div>Do continue strategic discussions throughout the year, building an internal rhythm that keeps focus on the choices that matter.</div></li><li><div>Do think about clarity and simplicity when communicating key strategic choices to the organization.</div></li><li><div>Do build systems and measures that support both enterprise-wide capabilities and business-specific capabilities.</div></li><li><div>Do define measures that will tell you, over the short and long run, how you are performing relative to your strategic choices.</div></li></ul><li><div>COMMUNICATING TO THE ORGANIZATION</div></li><ul><li><div>Clearer, simpler strategies have the best chance of winning, because they can be best understood and internalized by the organization.</div></li><li><div>I explicitly placed the consumer at the center of it all. I prioritized the consumer ahead of all other stakeholders, including customers, shareholders, and employees. I started with consumers, because the purpose of a business is to create consumers and to serve them better than anyone else can. No consumers, no business.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Chapter Seven: Think Through Strategy</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Without having an initial definition of winning, it is difficult to assess the value of any subsequent choice. You need a winning aspiration against which you can weigh different choices. But remember that strategy is an iterative process, and you’ll need to return to refine your winning aspiration in the context of the subsequent choices.</div></li><li><div>Consider the real work of strategy as beginning with where to play and how to win—the very heart of strategy. These are the choices that actually define what you will do, and where you will do it, so as to generate competitive advantage.</div></li><li><div>There are four dimensions you need to think about to choose where to play and how to win:</div></li><ul><li><div>The industry. What is the structure of your industry and the attractiveness of its segments?</div></li><li><div>Customers. What do your channel and end customers value?</div></li><li><div>Relative position. How does your company fare, and how could it fare, relative to the competition?</div></li><li><div>Competition. What will your competition do in reaction to your chosen course of action?</div></li></ul><li><div>Strategy logic flow spurs a thoughtful analysis of your company’s current reality, context, challenges, and opportunities</div></li><li><div>Industry Analysis</div></li><ul><li><div>You must ask, what might be the distinct segments of the industry in question (geographically, by consumer preference, by distribution channel, etc.)? Which segmentation scheme makes the most sense for the given industry today, and what might make sense in the future? And what is the relative attractiveness of those segments, now and in the future?</div></li></ul><li><div>Segmentation</div></li><ul><li><div>Industry segments are distinctive subsets of the larger industry along lines such as geography, product or service type, channel, customer or consumer needs, and so on.</div></li><li><div>In many cases, the accepted, traditional industry maps are imperfect. Like the old maps of a flat world that showed edges you could sail off, industry maps have limitations; only by exploring the edges of those maps can you see things differently.</div></li></ul><li><div>Attractiveness</div></li><ul><li><div>Other things being equal, a firm would want to play in segments that have higher profit potential based on their structural characteristics.</div></li></ul><li><div>The five forces can be divided into two axes.</div></li><ul><li><div>The vertical axis—threat from new entrants and threat of substitute products—determines how much value is generated by the industry (and is therefore available to be split up among industry players). If it is very difficult for new players to enter the industry and there are no substitutes to the industry’s product or services to which buyers can turn, then the industry will generate high value.</div></li><li><div>The horizontal axis determines which entity will capture the industry value—suppliers, producers, or buyers.</div></li><li><div>If the suppliers are larger and more powerful than the producers, the suppliers will appropriate more of the value (think Microsoft and Intel in the PC business).</div></li><li><div>If, on the other hand, the buyers are large and powerful, they will get a greater portion of the value (think Walmart versus the many small manufacturers whose products fill their shelves).</div></li><li><div>If rivalry between competitors is high, the dynamic will facilitate the appropriation of value by suppliers or buyers. A low degree of rivalry will protect profitability for the producers.</div></li><li><div>Industries with fewer rivals and with competitors that seek to serve different parts of the market with unique offerings are more attractive than those in which a number of competitors compete fiercely for the same consumers in the same way.</div></li><li><div>Understanding structural attractiveness allows individual managers to determine how to invest in various segments within their business.</div></li><li><div>Industry analysis also enables a company to migrate its portfolio toward more structurally attractive businesses and away from less attractive ones.</div></li><li><div>Customer Value Analysis</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Regardless of whether a firm wishes to be a cost leader or a differentiator, it needs to understand precisely what customers (its own and its competitors’ customers) value.</span></div></li><li><div>In customer value analysis, the company assesses what its channel customers and end consumers really want and need, and what value they derive from the firm’s products and services relative to the costs they incur from buying and using the products or services.</div></li></ul><li><div>Channel</div></li><ul><li><div>For channel customers, profit margin, the ability to drive traffic, trade terms, and delivery consistency all tend to play into the value equation, along with many other variables that depend on the nature of the business.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding customer value requires deep engagement.</span></div></li><li><div>Understand their customer so well that they could work collaboratively to develop mutual business goals, joint value creation strategies, and shared action plans to win.</div></li><li><div>End Consumers</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding end consumers is a challenging thing, because you can’t simply ask what they want, need, and value.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Analysis of Relative Position</div></li><ul><li><div>In terms of relative capabilities, the question is, how do your capabilities stack up, and how could they stack up, against those of your competitors in meeting the identified needs of customers (both channel and end consumer)?</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">How could your capabilities be configured to translate to a measurable, sustainable competitive advantage?</span></div></li><li><div>Pharmaceuticals require a long, complex clinical trial and FDA-approval process; they are largely sold directly to doctors and pharmacies, with little or no ability to influence the end consumer; for many of the products, there was no long-term usage opportunity, which made it hard to use P&amp;G brand-building capabilities to build a sustainable tie with consumers; and there was little crossover between P&amp;G core technologies and the technologies needed to innovate in pharmaceuticals. So, P&amp;G exited the industry,</div></li><li><div>Does the organization have a scale, branding, or product development advantage that enables it to deliver a superior value offering at the same cost as the cost incurred by competitors?</div></li><li><div>Does it have a scale advantage, a learning-curve advantage, a proprietary process, or a technology that enables it to have a superior cost position?</div></li><li><div>Relative cost was a concern for Olay as well. By staying in the mass channel, P&amp;G could have a dramatically lower cost structure than its prestige competitors, which needed to invest massively in store fixtures and in-store personnel. The cost savings from keeping Olay in mass retail could be funneled into innovation and marketing to create competitive advantage.</div></li><li><div>is there some competitive response that could undermine or trump the where-to-play and how-to-win choices?</div></li><li><div>Inevitably, this is guesswork to some degree; you can’t know for sure what a competitor will or won’t do in the face of your actions.</div></li><li><div>It is far better to ask what your competitors will likely do before you proceed than to simply wait and see what happens.</div></li><li><div>A strategy that only works if competitors continue to do exactly what they are already doing is a dangerous strategy indeed.</div></li><li><div>Capabilities</div></li><li><div>Costs</div></li><li><div>Competitive Analysis</div></li></ul><li><div>A Framework for Strategy</div></li><ul><li><div>The strategy logic flow can point you to the key areas of analysis necessary to generate sustainable competitive advantage.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">First, look to understand the industry in which you play (or will play)</span>, its distinct segments and their relative attractiveness.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Next, turn to customers</span>. What do channel and end consumers truly want, need, and value—and how do those needs fit with your current or potential offerings?</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">After customers, the lens turns inward: what are your capabilities and costs relative to the competition?</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Finally, consider competition; what will your competitors do in the face of your actions?</span></div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Strategy requires a diverse team with the various members bringing their distinct perspectives to bear on the problem. A process for working collaboratively on strategy is essential, because all companies are social entities, made up of a diverse network of individuals with different agendas and ideas.</span></div></li><li><div>STRATEGY LOGIC FLOW DOS AND DON’TS</div></li><ul><li><div>Do explore all four critical dimensions of strategy choice: industry, customers, relative position, and competition.</div></li><li><div>Don’t accept that entire industries are or must be unattractive; explore the drivers of different dynamics in different segments, and ask how the game could be changed.</div></li></ul></ul>

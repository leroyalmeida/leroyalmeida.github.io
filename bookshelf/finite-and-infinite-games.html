          <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><div>THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO KINDS OF GAMES</div></li><ul><li><div>A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.</div></li><li><div>If a finite game is to be won by someone it must come to a definitive end. It will come to an end when someone has won.</div></li><li><div>We know that someone has won the game when all the players have agreed who among them is the winner</div></li><li><div>There is no finite game unless the players freely choose to play it. No one can play who is forced to play</div></li><li><div>It is an invariable principle of all play, finite and infinite, that whoever plays, plays freely. Whoever must play, cannot play.</div></li><li><div>Just as it is essential for a finite game to have a definitive ending, it must also have a precise beginning. Therefore, we can speak of finite games as having temporal boundaries-to which, of course, all players must agree</div></li><li><div>Players must agree to the establishment of spatial and numerical boundaries as well. That is, the game must be played within a marked area, and with specified players.</div></li><li><div>Persons are selected for finite play. It is the case that we cannot play if we must play, but it is also the case that we cannot play alone. Thus, in every case, we must find an opponent, and in most cases teammates, who are willing to join in play with us</div></li><li><div>Because finite players cannot select themselves for play, there is never a time when they cannot be removed from the game, or when the other contestants cannot refuse to play with them</div></li><li><div>What is preserved by the constancy of numerical boundaries, of course, is the possibility that all contestants can agree on an eventual winner</div></li><li><div>To have such boundaries means that the date, place, and membership of each finite game are externally defined</div></li><li><div>Only one person or team can win a finite game, but the other contestants may well be ranked at the conclusion of play.</div></li><li><div>There are many games we enter not expecting to win, but in which we nonetheless compete for the highest possible ranking</div></li><li><div>In one respect, but only one, an infinite game is identical to a finite game: Of infinite players we can also say that if they play they play freely; if they must play, they cannot play.</div></li><li><div>There are no spatial or numerical boundaries to an infinite game. No world is marked with the barriers of infinite play, and there is no question of eligibility since anyone who wishes may play an infinite game.</div></li><li><div>While finite games are externally defined, infinite games are internally defined</div></li><li><div>Finite games can be played within an infinite game, but an infinite game cannot be played within a finite game</div></li><li><div>Infinite players regard their wins and losses in whatever finite games they playas but moments in continuing play.</div></li><li><div>The rules will be different for each finite game. It is, in fact, by knowing what the rules are that we know what the game is.</div></li><li><div>In the narrowest sense rules are not laws; they do not man-date specific behavior, but only restrain the freedom of the players, allowing considerable room for choice within those restraints.</div></li><li><div>If these restraints are not observed, the outcome of the game is directly threatened. The rules of a finite game are the contractual terms by which the players can agree who has won.</div></li><li><div>The rules must be published prior to play, and the players must agree to them before play begins.</div></li><li><div>The agreement of the players to the applicable rules constitutes the ultimate validation of those rules.</div></li><li><div>If the rules of a finite game are unique to that game it is evident that the rules may not change in the course of play-else a different game is being played.</div></li><li><div>The rules of an infinite game must change in the course of play</div></li><li><div>The rules of an infinite game are changed to prevent anyone from winning the game and to bring as many persons as possible into the play</div></li><li><div>If the rules of a finite game are the contractual terms by which the players can agree who has won, the rules of an infinite game are the contractual terms by which the players agree to continue playing.</div></li><li><div>The rules of an infinite game have a different status from those of a finite game. They are like the grammar of a living language, where those of a finite game are like the rules of debate. In the former case we observe rules as a way of continuing discourse with each other; in the latter we observe rules as a way of bringing the speech of another person to an end.</div></li><li><div>The rules are always designed to deal with specific threats to the continuation of play. Infinite players use the rules to regulate the way they will take the boundaries or limits being forced against their play into the game itself</div></li><li><div>The task is to design rules that will allow the players to continue the game by taking these limits into playâ€”even when death is one of the limits. It is in this sense that the game is infinite.</div></li><li><div>This is equivalent to saying that no limitation may be im-posed against infinite play. Since limits are taken into play, the play itself cannot be limited.</div></li><li><div>Finite players play within boundaries; infinite players play with boundaries.</div></li><li><div>We saw that finite players must be selected. While no one is forced to remain a lawyer or a rodeo performer or a kundalini yogi after being selected for these roles, each role is nonetheless surrounded both by ruled restraints and expectations on the part of others. One senses a compulsion to main-tain a certain level of performance, because permission to play in these games can be canceled. We cannot do whatever we please and remain lawyers or yogis and yet we could not be either unless we pleased.</div></li><li><div>Since finite games are played to be won, players make every move in a game in order to win it. Whatever is not done in the interest of winning is not part of the game.</div></li><li><div>It may appear that the prizes for winning are indispensable, that without them life is meaningless, perhaps even impos-sible.</div></li><li><div>Whoever takes up the commanded role does so by choice.</div></li><li><div>Unlike infinite play, finite play is limited from without;</div></li><li><div>like infinite play, those limitations must be chosen by the player since no one is under any necessity to play a finite game. Fields of play simply do not impose themselves on us. Therefore, all the limitations of finite play are self-limitations.</div></li><li><div>To account for the large gap between the actual freedom of finite players to step off the field of play at any time and the experienced necessity to stay at the struggle, we can say that as finite players we somehow veil this freedom from ourselves.</div></li><li><div>Some self-veiling is present in all finite games. Players must intentionally forget the inherently voluntary nature of their play, else all competitive effort will desert them</div></li><li><div>Of course, not for a second will this woman in her acting be unaware that she is acting. She never forgets that she has veiled herself sufficiently to play this role, that she has chosen to forget for the moment that she is this woman and not Ophelia. But then, neither do we as audience forget we are audience. Even though we see this woman as Ophelia, we are never in doubt that she is not. We are in complicity with her veil. We allow her performed emotions to affect us, perhaps powerfully. But we never forget that we allow them to do so.</div></li><li><div>Only freely can one step into the role of mother. Persons who assume this role, however, must suspend their freedom with a proper seriousness in order to act as the role requires. A mother's words, actions, and feelings belong to the role and not to the person-although some persons may veil themselves so assiduously that they make their performance believable even to themselves, overlooking any distinction between a mother's feelings and their own.</div></li><li><div>The issue here is not whether self-veiling can be avoided, or even should be avoided. Indeed, no finite play is possible without it. The issue is whether we are ever willing to drop the veil and openly acknowledge, if only to ourselves, that we have freely chosen to face the world through a mask.</div></li><li><div>At which point do we confront the fact that we live one life and perform another, or others, attempting to make our momentary forgetting true and lasting forgetting?</div></li><li><div>What makes this an issue is not the morality of masking ourselves. It is rather that self-veiling is a contradictory act-a free suspension of our freedom. I cannot forget that I have forgotten. I may have used the veil so successfully that I have made my performance believable to myself.</div></li><li><div>If no amount of veiling can conceal the veiling itself, the issue is how far we will go in our seriousness at self-veiling, and how far we will go to have others act in complicity with us.</div></li><li><div>Since finite games can be played within an infinite game, infinite players do not eschew the performed roles of finite play. On the contrary, they enter into finite games with all the appropriate energy and self-veiling, but they do so without the seriousness of finite players</div></li><li><div>They embrace the abstractness of finite games as abstractness, and therefore take them up not seriously, but playfully</div></li><li><div>They freely use masks in their social engagements, but not without acknowledging to themselves and others that they are masked. For that reason they regard each participant in finite play as that person playing and not as a role played by someone.</div></li><li><div>Seriousness is always related to roles, or abstractions. We are likely to be more serious with police officers when we find them uniformed and performing their mandated roles than when we find them in the process of changing into their uniforms.</div></li><li><div>To be playful is not to be trivial or frivolous, or to act as though nothing of consequence will happen. On the contrary, when we are playful with each other we relate as free persons, and the relationship is open to surprise; everything that hap-pens is of consequence. It is, in fact, seriousness that closes itself to consequence, for seriousness is a dread of the unpre-dictable outcome of open possibility. To be serious is to press for a specified conclusion. To be playful is to allow for possibil-ity whatever the cost to oneself.</div></li><li><div>There is, however, a familiar form of playfulness often associated with situations protected from consequence-where no matter what we do (within certain limits), nothing will come of it. This is not playing so much as it is playing at, a harmless disregard for social constraints. While this is by no means excluded from infinite play, it is not the same as infinite play.</div></li><li><div>For that reason an infinite game cannot be abstracted, for it is not a part of the whole presenting itself as the whole, but the whole that knows it is the whole.</div></li><li><div>Inasmuch as a finite game is intended for conclusion, inas-much as its roles are scripted and performed for an audience, we shall refer to finite playas theatrical. Although script and plot do not seem to be written in advance, we are always able to look back at the path followed to victory and say of the winners that they certainly knew how to act and what to say.</div></li><li><div>Inasmuch as infinite players avoid any outcome whatsoever, keeping the future open, making all scripts useless, we shall refer to infinite playas dramatic.</div></li><li><div>Dramatically, one chooses to be a mother; theatrically, one takes on the role of mother.</div></li><li><div>One obeys the rules in a finite game in order to play, but playing does not consist only in obeying rules.</div></li><li><div>The rules of a finite game do not constitute a script. A script is composed according to the rules but is not identical to the rules.</div></li><li><div>This means that during the game all finite play is dramatic, since the outcome is yet unknown. That the outcome is not known is what makes it a true game. The theatricality of finite play has to do with the fact that there is an outcome.</div></li><li><div>Finite play is dramatic, but only provisionally dramatic.</div></li><li><div>As soon as it is concluded we are able to look backward and see how the sequence of moves, though made freely by the competitors, could have resulted only in this outcome.</div></li><li><div>The fact that a finite game is provisionally dramatic means that it is the intention of each player to eliminate its drama by making a preferred end inevitable.</div></li><li><div>It is the desire of all finite players to be Master Players, to be so perfectly skilled in their play that nothing can surprise them, so perfectly trained that every move in the game is foreseen at the beginning. A true Master Player plays as though the game is already in the past, according to a script whose every detail is known prior to the play itself.</div></li><li><div>Surprise is a crucial element in most finite games. If we are not prepared to meet each of the possible moves of an opponent, our chances of losing are most certainly increased.</div></li><li><div>It is therefore by surprising our opponent that we are most likely to win. Surprise in finite play is the triumph of the past over the future. The Master Player who already knows what moves are to be made has a decisive advantage over the unprepared player who does not yet know what moves will be made.</div></li><li><div>A finite player is trained not only to anticipate every future possibility, but to control the future, to prevent it from altering the past.</div></li><li><div>Infinite players, on the other hand, continue their play in the expectation of being surprised. If surprise is no longer possible, all play ceases.</div></li><li><div>Surprise causes finite play to end; it is the reason for infinite play to continue.</div></li><li><div>Surprise in infinite play is the triumph of the future over the past. Since infinite players do not regard the past as having an outcome, they have no way of knowing what has been begun there. With each surprise, the past reveals a new begin-ning in itself. Inasmuch as the future is always surprising, the past is always changing</div></li><li><div>Because finite players are trained to prevent the future from altering the past, they must hide their future moves. The unprepared opponent must be kept unprepared. Finite players must appear to be something other than what they are. Every-thing about their appearance must be concealing</div></li><li><div>Because infinite players prepare themselves to be surprised by the future, they play in complete openness. It is not an openness as in candor, but an openness as in vulnerability.</div></li><li><div>It is not a matter of exposing one's unchanging identity, the true self that has always been, but a way of exposing one's ceaseless growth, the dynamic self that has yet to be</div></li><li><div>To be prepared against surprise is to be trained. To be prepared for surprise is to be educated.</div></li><li><div>Education discovers an increasing richness in the past, be-cause it sees what is unfinished there. Training regards the past as finished and the future as to be finished. Education leads toward a continuing self-discovery; training leads toward a final self-definition.</div></li><li><div>Training repeats a completed past in the future. Education continues an unfinished past into the future.</div></li><li><div>What one wins in a finite game is a title.</div></li><li><div>A title is the acknowledgment of others that one has been the winner of a particular game. Titles are public. They are for others to notice. I expect others to address me according to my titles, but I do not address myself with them-unless, of course, I address myself as an other. The effectiveness of a title depends on its visibility, its noticeability to others.</div></li><li><div>Any given finite game can be played many times, although each occasion of its occurrence is unique. The game that was played at that time by those players can never be played agam.</div></li><li><div>A finite game must always be won with a terminal move, a final act within the boundaries of the game that establishes the winner beyond any possibility of challenge. A terminal move results, in other words, in the death of the opposing player as player.</div></li><li><div>Death, in finite play, is the triumph of the past over the future, a condition in which no surprise is possible.</div></li><li><div>There are two ways in which death is commonly associated with the fate of the body: One can be dead in life, or one can be alive in death.</div></li><li><div>Death in life is a mode of existence in which one has ceased all play; there is no further striving for titles. All competitive engagement with others has been abandoned.</div></li><li><div>Life in death concerns those who are titled and whose titles, since they are timeless, may not be extinguished by death. Immortality, in this case, is not a reward but the condition necessary to the possession of rewards.</div></li><li><div>Soldiers commonly achieve a life in death. Soldiers fight not to stay alive but to save the nation. Those who do fight only to protect themselves are, in fact, considered guilty of the highest military crimes. Soldiers who die fighting the en-emy, however, receive the nation's highest reward: They are declared unforgettable. Even unknown soldiers are memorial-ized-though their names have been lost, their titles will not be.</div></li><li><div>What the winners of finite games achieve is not properly an afterlife but an afterworld, not continuing existence but continuing recognition of their titles.</div></li><li><div>When life is viewed by a finite player as the award to be won, then death is a token of defeat. Death is not, therefore, chosen, but inflicted. It happens to one when the struggle against it fails. Death comes as a judgment, a dishonor, a sign of certain weakness. Death for the finite player is deserved, earned.</div></li><li><div>There is a contradiction here: If the prize for winning finite play is life, then the players are not properly alive. They are competing for life. Life, then, is not play, but the outcome of play. Finite players play to live; they do not live their playing. Life is therefore deserved, bestowed, possessed, won. It is not lived.</div></li></ul><ul><li><div>This is a contradiction common to all finite play. Because the purpose of a finite game is to bring play to an end with the victory of one of the players, each finite game is played to end itself. The contradiction is precisely that all finite play is play against itself.</div></li><li><div>Death, for finite players, is abstract, not concrete. It is not the whole person, but only an abstracted fragment of the whole, that dies in life or lives in death</div></li><li><div>So all is life abstract for finite players. It is not the whole person who lives.</div></li><li><div>Immortality, therefore, is the triumph of such abstraction.</div></li><li><div>It is a state of unrelieved theatricality. An immortal soul is a person who cannot help but continue living out a role already scripted. An immortal person could not choose to die nor, for the same reason, choose to live</div></li><li><div>Immortality is the state of forgetting that we have forgotten-that is, overlooking the fact that we freely decided to enter into finite play, a decision in itself playful and not serious.</div></li><li><div>Immortality is therefore the supreme example of the contra-dictoriness of finite play: It is a life one cannot live.</div></li><li><div>Where the finite player plays for immortality, the infinite player plays as a mortal. In infinite play one chooses to be mortal inasmuch as one always plays dramatically, that is, toward the open, toward the horizon, toward surprise, where nothing can be scripted</div></li><li><div>The finite play for life is serious; the infinite play of life is joyous.</div></li><li><div>Infinite play resounds throughout with a kind of laughter. It is not a laughter at others who have come to an unexpected end, having thought they were going somewhere else. It is laughter with others with whom we have discovered that the end we thought we were coming to has unexpectedly opened. We laugh not at what has surprisingly come to be impossible for others, but over what has surprisingly come to be possible with others.</div></li><li><div>Infinite play is inherently paradoxical, just as finite play is inherently contradictory. Because it is the purpose of infinite players to continue the play, they do not play for themselves.</div></li><li><div>The contradiction of finite play is that the players desire to bring play to an end for themselves. The paradox of infinite play is that the players desire to continue the play in others.</div></li><li><div>Infinite players play best when they become least necessary to the continuation of play. It is for this reason they playas mortals.</div></li><li><div>The joyfulness of infinite play, its laughter, lies in learning to start something we cannot finish.</div></li><li><div>If finite players acquire titles from winning their games, we must say of infinite players that they have nothing but their names.</div></li><li><div>Titles are given at the end of play, names at the beginning.</div></li><li><div>When a person is known by title, the attention is on a completed past, on a game already concluded, and not there-fore to be played again. A title effectively takes a person out of play.</div></li><li><div>When a person is known only by name, the attention of others is on an open future. We simply cannot know what to expect.</div></li><li><div>Titles are abstractions; names are always concrete.</div></li><li><div>Titles are theatrical. Each title has a specified ceremonial form of address and behavior.</div></li><li><div>The titled are powerful. Those around them are expected to yield, to withdraw their opposition, and to conform to their will-in the arena in which the title was won.</div></li><li><div>The exercise of power always presupposes resistance. Power is never evident until two or more elements are in opposition.</div></li><li><div>If no one else ever strove to be a Boddhisattva or the Baton Twirling Champion of the State of Indiana, those titles would be powerless-no one would defer to them.</div></li><li><div>The exercise of power also presupposes a closed field and finite units of time.</div></li><li><div>The question is not whether I can lift ten pounds, but whether I can lift ten pounds five feet off the ground in one second--{)r within some other precise limitation of time and space. The establishment of the limits makes it possible to know how powerful I am in relation to others.</div></li><li><div>Power is always measured in units of comparison. In fact, it is a term of competition: How much resistance can I over-come relative to others?</div></li><li><div>Power is a concept that belongs only in finite play. But power is not properly measurable until the game is com-pleted-until the designated period of time has run out.</div></li><li><div>To speak meaningfully of a person's power is to speak of what that person has already completed in one or another closed field. To see power is to look backward in time.</div></li><li><div>Inasmuch as power is determined by the outcome of a game, one does not win by being powerful; one wins to be powerful. If one has sufficient power to win before the game has begun, what follows is not a game at all.</div></li><li><div>One can be powerful only through the possession of an acknowledged title-that is, only by the ceremonial deference of others</div></li><li><div>I can therefore have only what powers others give me.</div></li><li><div>Power is bestowed by an audience after the play is complete.</div></li><li><div>no one can engage us competitively unless we fully cooperate, unless we join the game and join it to win. Because power is measurable only in comparative-that is, competitive-terms, it presupposes some kind of cooperation. If we defer to titled winners, it is only because we regard ourselves as losers.</div></li><li><div>We are not defeated by floods or genetic disease or the rate of inflation. It is true that these are real, but we do not play against reality; we play according to reality. We do not eliminate weather or genetic influence but accept them as the realities that establish the context of play, the limits within which we are to play.</div></li><li><div>If I accept death as inevitable, I do not struggle against mortality. I struggle as a mortal.</div></li><li><div>All the limitations of finite play are self-limitations.</div></li><li><div>Infinite players look forward, not to a victory in which the past will achieve a timeless meaning, but toward ongoing play in which the past will require constant reinterpretation. Infinite players do not oppose the actions of others, but initiate actions of their own in such a way that others will respond by initiating their own.</div></li><li><div>where the finite player plays to be powerful the infinite player plays with strength.</div></li><li><div>A powerful person is one who brings the past to an outcome, settling all its unresolved issues. A strong person is one who carries the past into the future, showing that none of its issues is capable of resolution</div></li><li><div>Power is concerned with what has already happened; strength with what has yet to happen.</div></li><li><div>Power refers to the freedom persons have within limits, strength to the free-dom persons have with limits.</div></li><li><div>Power will always be restricted to a relatively small number of selected persons. Anyone can be strong.</div></li><li><div>Strength is paradoxical. I am not strong because I can force others to do what I wish as a result of my play with them, but because I can allow them to do what they wish in the course of my play with them.</div></li><li><div>Infi-nite play cannot prevent or eliminate evil. Though infinite players are strong, they are not powerful and do not attempt to become powerful.</div></li><li><div>Evil is the termination of infinite play. It is infinite play coming to an end in unheard silence.</div></li><li><div>Unheard silence is not the loss of the player's voice, but the loss of listeners for that voice. It is an evil when the drama of a life does not continue in others for reason of their deafness or ignorance.</div></li><li><div>Evil is not the termination of a finite game. Finite players, even those who play for their own lives, know the stakes of the games they freely choose to play.</div></li><li><div>Evil is not the attempt to eliminate the play of another according to published and accepted rules, but to eliminate the play of another regardless of the rules</div></li><li><div>Evil is not the acquisition of power, but the expression of power. It is the forced recognition of a title-and therein lies the contradiction of evil, for recognition cannot be forced</div></li><li><div>Evil is never intended as evil. Indeed, the contradiction inherent in all evil is that it originates in the desire to eliminate evil.</div></li><li><div>Infinite players understand the inescapable likelihood of evil. They therefore do not attempt to eliminate evil in others, for to do so is the very impulse of evil itself, and therefore a contradiction. They only attempt paradoxically to recognize in themselves the evil that takes the form of attempting to eliminate evil elsewhere</div></li><li><div>Evil is not the inclusion of finite games in an infinite game, but the restriction of all play to one or another finite game.</div></li></ul><li><div>NO ONE CAN PLAY A GAME ALONE</div></li><ul><li><div>We do not relate to others as the persons we are; we are who we are in relating to others.</div></li><li><div>ceaseless change does not mean discontinuity;</div></li><li><div>rather change is itself the very basis of our continuity as per-sons.</div></li><li><div>Only that which can change can continue: this is the principle by which infinite players live.</div></li><li><div>how to keep all our finite games in infinite play.</div></li><li><div>This challenge is commonly misunderstood as the need to find room for playfulness within finite games. This is what was referred to above as playing at, or perhaps playing around, a kind of play that has no consequence</div></li><li><div>The executive's vacation, like the football team's time out, comes to be a device for refreshing the contes-tant for a higher level of competition.</div></li><li><div>"We must learn the fine arts of war and independence so that our children can learn architecture and engineering so that their children may learn the fine arts and painting" (John Quincy Adams).</div></li><li><div>political realities do not precede, but follow from, the essential fluidity of our humanness.</div></li><li><div>This does not mean that infinite players are politically disen-gaged; it means rather that they are political without having a politics,</div></li><li><div>To have a politics is to have a set of rules by which one attempts to reach a desired end; to be political-in the sense meant here-is to recast rules in the attempt to eliminate all societal ends, that is, to maintain the essential fluidity of human association</div></li><li><div>No nation can go to war until it has found another that can agree to the terms of the conflict. Each side must therefore be in complicity with the other: Before I can have an enemy, I must persuade another to recognize me as an enemy. I cannot be a hero unless I can first find someone who will threaten my life-or, better, take my life. Once under way, warfare and acts of heroism have all the appearance of necessity, but that ap-pearance is but a veil over the often complicated maneuvers by which the antagonists have arranged their conflict with each other.</div></li><li><div>for infinite players, politics is a form of theatrical-ity. It is the performance of roles before an audience, according to a script whose last scene is known in advance by the perform-ers</div></li><li><div>In their own political engagements infinite players make a distinction between society and culture. Society they under-stand as the sum of those relations that are under some form of public constraint, culture as whatever we do with each other by undirected choice.</div></li><li><div>Society remains entirely within our free choice in quite the same way that finite competition, however strenu-ous or costly to the player, never prevents the player from walking off the field of play. Society applies only to those areas of action which are believed to be necessary</div></li><li><div>Just as infinite play cannot be contained within finite play, culture cannot be authentic if held within the boundaries of a society. Of course, it is often the strategy of a society to initiate and embrace a culture as exclusively its own.</div></li><li><div>Society and culture are therefore not true opponents of each other. Rather society is a species of culture that persists in contradicting itself, a freely organized attempt to conceal the freedom of the organizers and the organized, an attempt to forget that we have willfully forgotten our decision to enter this or that contest and to continue in it.</div></li><li><div>If we think of society as all that a people does under the veil of necessity, we must also think of it as a single finite game that includes any number of smaller games within its boundaries</div></li><li><div>Like a finite game, a society is numerically, spatially, and temporally limited. Its citizenship is precisely defined, its boundaries are inviolable, and its past is enshrined</div></li><li><div>The power of citizens in a society is determined by their ranking in games that have been played. A society preserves its memory of past winners</div></li><li><div>The power of a society is determined by its victory over other societies in still larger finite games.</div></li><li><div>The power in a society is guaranteed and enhanced by the power of a society.</div></li><li><div>The prizes won by its citizens can be protected only if the society as a whole remains powerful in relation to other societies. Those who desire the permanence of their prizes will work to sustain the permanence of the whole</div></li><li><div>Culture, on the other hand, is an infinite game. Culture has no boundaries. Anyone can be a participant in a culture-anywhere and at any time.</div></li><li><div>culture understands its past not as destiny, but as history, that is, as a narrative that has begun but points always toward the endlessly open</div></li><li><div>Society is a manifestation of power. It is theatrical, having an established script. Deviations from the script are evident at once. Deviation is antisocietal and therefore forbidden by society under a variety of sanctions. It is easy to see why deviancy is to be resisted. If persons did not adhere to the standing rules of the society, any number of rules would change, and some would be dropped altogether.</div></li><li><div>Deviancy, however, is the very essence of culture. Whoever merely follows the script, merely repeating the past, is cultur-ally impoverished.</div></li><li><div>There are variations in the quality of deviation; not all diver-gence from the past is culturally significant. Any attempt to vary from the past in such a way as to cut the past off, causing it to be forgotten, has little cultural importance. Greater signif-icance attaches to those variations that bring the tradition into view in a new way, allowing the familiar to be seen as unfamiliar, as requiring a new appraisal of all that we have been-and therefore of all that we are.</div></li><li><div>Cultural deviation does not return us to the past, but contin-ues what was begun and not finished in the past. Societal convention, on the other hand, requires that a completed past be repeated in the future</div></li><li><div>Finite games can be played again; they can be played an indefinite number of times. It is true that the winners of a game are always the winners of a game played at that particular time, but the validity of their titles depends on the repeatability of that game.</div></li><li><div>As we have seen, because an infinite game cannot be brought to an end, it cannot be repeated. Unrepeatability is a character-istic of culture everywhere.</div></li><li><div>Society preserves these works as the prizes of those who have triumphed in their respective games. Culture, however, does not consider the works as the outcome of a struggle, but as moments in an ongoing struggle-the very struggle that culture is.</div></li><li><div>Just as an infinite game has rules, a culture has a tradition.</div></li><li><div>Since the rules of play in an infinite game are freely agreed to and freely altered, a cultural tradition is both adopted and transformed in its adoption.</div></li><li><div>What the winner of a finite game wins is a title. A title is the acknowledgment of others that one has been the winner of a particular game. I cannot entitle myself. Titles are theatri-cal, requiring an audience to bestow and respect them.</div></li><li><div>Power attaches to titles inasmuch as those who acknowledge them accept the fact that the struggle in which the titles were won cannot be taken up again. Possession of the title signifies an agreement that competition is forever closed in that particu-lar game.</div></li><li><div>It is therefore essential to the effectiveness of every title that it be visible and that in its visibility it point back at the contest in which it was won.</div></li><li><div>Property may be stolen, but the thief does not therefore own it. Ownership can never be stolen. Titles are timeless, and so is the ownership of property.</div></li><li><div>One reason for the necessity of a society is its role in ascrib-ing and validating the titles to property.</div></li><li><div>There is no effective pattern of entitlement in a society short of the free agreement of all opponents that the titles to prop-erty are in the hands of the actual winners.</div></li><li><div>It is agreement that establishes force. Only those who consent to a society's constraints see them as constraints-that is, as guides to action and not as actions to be opposed.</div></li><li><div>One does not win by power; one wins to be powerful.</div></li><li><div>Only by free self-concealment can persons believe they obey the law because the law is powerful; in fact, the law is powerful for persons only because they obey it. We do not proceed through a traffic intersection because the signal changes, but when the signal changes.</div></li><li><div>If property is to be persuasively emblematic, that is, if it is to draw attention to the owner's titles in past victories, a double burden falls on its owners:</div></li><li><div>First, they must show that the amount of their property corresponds to the difficulty they were under in winning title to it. Property must be seen as compensation.</div></li><li><div>Second, they must show that the type of their property corresponds to the nature of the competition by which title to it was won. Property must be seen to be consumed.</div></li><li><div>Property is appropriately compensatory whenever owners can show that what is gained is no more than what was ex-pended in the effort to acquire it. There must be an equiva-lency between what the owners have given of themselves and what they have received from others by way of their titles</div></li><li><div>Whoever is unable to show a correspondence between wealth and the risks undergone to acquire it, or the talents spent in its acquisition, will soon face a challenge over entitle-ment.</div></li><li><div>Property is an attempt to recover the past. It returns one to precompetitive status. One is compensated for the amount of time spent (and thus lost) in competition.</div></li><li><div>This attempt to recover the past is, however, a theatrical attempt which can succeed only to the degree that it is conspic-uous to its audience. Property must take up space. It must be somewhere-and somewhere obvious. That is, it must exist in such a form that others will come upon it and take notice of it. Our property must intrude on another, stand in another's way, causing one to contend with it.</div></li><li><div>we cannot be justified in owning what we do not need to use or plan to use.</div></li><li><div>Consumption is to be understood as an intentional activity</div></li><li><div>Consumption is a kind of activity that is directly opposite to the very form of engagement by which the title was won.</div></li><li><div>It must be the kind of activity that can convince all observers that the possesser's title to it is no longer in question.</div></li><li><div>The more powerful we consider persons to be, the less we expect them to do, for their power can come only from that which they have done.</div></li><li><div>Conspicuous abstention from labour therefore becomes the conventional mark of superior pecuniary achievement and the conventional index of reputability; and conversely, since application to pro-ductive labour is a mark of poverty and subjection, it becomes inconsistent with a reputable standing in the community" (Veblen)</div></li><li><div>Just as compensation makes itself conspicuous by taking up space, consumption draws attention to itself by the length of time it continues. Property must not only intrude on others, it must continue to intrude on others</div></li><li><div>It is the common goal of the ;'ich to establish a mode of visibility that will extend itself over generations by executing wills that prevent the rapid exhaustion of their fortune, by endowing societally important institutions, by erecting great buildings in their name. Persons of small victories, of lower rank, do not have property of great temporal value; what they have will be ex-hausted quickly</div></li><li><div>It is apparent to infinite players that wealth is not so much possessed as it is performed.</div></li><li><div>Some societies develop the belief that they can eliminate thievery by guaranteeing all their members, including thieves, a certain amount of property-the impulse behind much social welfare legislation. But putting a coin into the pocket of the Artful Dodger will hardly convince him that he is no longer a legitimate contender for the coin in mine.</div></li><li><div>The more effective policy for a society is to find ways of persuading its thieves to abandon their role as competitors for property for the sake of becoming audience to the theater of wealth. It is for this reason that societies fall back on the skill of those poietai who can theatricalize the property rela-tions, and indeed, all the inner structures of each society.</div></li><li><div>If wealth and might are to be performed, great wealth and great might must be performed brilliantly.</div></li><li><div>While societal thinkers may not overlook the importance of poiesis, or creative activity, neither may they underestimate its danger, for the poietai are the ones most likely to remember what has been forgotten-that society is a species of culture.</div></li><li><div>The deepest and most consequent struggle of each society is therefore not with other societies, but with the culture that exists within itself-the culture that is itself.</div></li><li><div>Powerful societies do not silence their poietai in order that they may go to war; they go to war as a way of silencing their poietai. Original thinkers can be suppressed through execution and exile, or they can be encouraged through subsidy and flattery to praise the society's heroes</div></li><li><div>Another successful defense of society against the culture within itself is to give artists a place by regarding them as the producers of property, thus elevating the value of consum-ing art, or owning it. It is notable that very large collections of art, and all the world's major museums, are the work of the very rich or of societies during strongly nationalistic peri-ods.</div></li><li><div>Such museums are not designed to protect the art from people, but to protect the people from art.</div></li><li><div>Culture is likely to break out in a society not when its poietai begin to voice a line contrary to that of the society, but when they begin to ignore all lines whatsoever and concern themselves with bringing the audience back into play-not competitive play, but play that affirms itself as play</div></li><li><div>Art that is used against a society or its policies gives up its character as infinite play, and aims for an end</div></li><li><div>Once warfare, or any other societal activity, has been taken into the infinite play of poiesis so that it appears to be either comical or pointless (in the way that, say, beauty is pointless), there is an acute danger that the soldiers will find no audience for their prizes, and therefore no reason to fight for them.</div></li><li><div>Since culture is itself a poiesis, all of its participants are poietai-inventors, makers, artists, storytellers, mythologists.</div></li><li><div>They are not, however, makers of actualities, but makers of possibilities. The creativity of culture has no outcome, no conclusion</div></li><li><div>Art is not art, therefore, except as it leads to an engendering creativity in its beholders. Whoever takes possession of the objects of art has not taken possession of the art.</div></li><li><div>Since art is never possession, and always possibility, nothing possessed can have the status of art.</div></li><li><div>Property draws attention to titles, points backward toward a finished time.</div></li><li><div>Art is dramatic, opening always forward, beginning something that cannot be finished.</div></li><li><div>We are not artists by reason of having mastered certain skills or exercising specified techniques. Art has no scripted roles for its perform-ers. It is precisely because it has none that it is art.</div></li><li><div>We do not watch artists to see what they do, but watch what persons do and discover the artistry in it.</div></li><li><div>Artists cannot be trained. One does not become an artist by acquiring certain skills or techniques, though one can use any number of skills and techniques in artistic activity. The creative is found in anyone who is prepared for surprise. Such a person cannot go to school to be an artist, but can only go to school as an artist.</div></li><li><div>To regard society as a species of culture is not to overthrow or even alter society, but only to eliminate its perceived neces-sity. Infinite players have rules; they just do not forget that rules are an expression of agreement and not a requirement for agreement.</div></li><li><div>Infinite players never understand their culture as the composite of all that they choose individually to do, but as the congruence of all that they choose to do with each other</div></li><li><div>where a society is defined by its boundaries, a culture is defined by its horizon.</div></li><li><div>A boundary is a phenomenon of opposition. It is the meeting place of hostile forces. Where nothing opposes there can be no boundary. One cannot move beyond a boundary without being resisted.</div></li><li><div>This is why patriotism-that is, the desire to protect the power in a society by way of increasing the power of a society-is inherently belligerent. Since there can be no prizes without a society, no society without opponents, patriots must create enemies before we can require protection from them. Patriots can flourish only where boundaries are well-defined, hostile, and dangerous</div></li><li><div>A horizon is a phenomenon of vision. One cannot look at the horizon; it is simply the point beyond which we cannot see. There is nothing in the horizon itself, however, that limits vision, for the horizon opens onto all that lies beyond itself.</div></li><li><div>What limits vision is rather the incompleteness of that vision.</div></li><li><div>One never reaches a horizon. It is not a line; it has no place; it encloses no field; its location is always relative to the view.</div></li><li><div>We are never somewhere in relation to the horizon since the horizon moves with our vision. We can only be somewhere by turning away from the horizon, by replacing vision with opposition, by declaring the place on which we stand to be timeless-a sacred region, a holy land, a body of truth, a code of inviolable commandments. To be somewhere is to absolutize time, space, and number.</div></li><li><div>Every move an infinite player makes is toward the horizon.</div></li><li><div>Every move made by a finite player is within a bound-ary. Every moment of an infinite game therefore presents a new vision, a new range of possibilities. The Renaissance, like all genuine cultural phenomena, was not an effort to pro-mote one or another vision. It was an effort to find visions that promised still more vision.</div></li><li><div>Since culture is horizonal it is not restricted by time or space.</div></li><li><div>To the degree that the Renaissance was true culture it has not ended. Anyone may enter into its mode of renewing vision. This does not mean that we repeat what was done.</div></li><li><div>To enter a culture is not to do what the others do, but to do whatever one does with the others.</div></li><li><div>This is why every new participant in a culture both enters into an existing context and simultaneously changes that con-text.</div></li><li><div>Each new adoption of a tradition makes it a new tradition-just as the family into which a child is born existed prior to that birth, but is nonetheless a new family after the birth.</div></li><li><div>The reciprocity of this transformation has no respect to time. The fact that the Renaissance began in the fourteenth or fifteenth century has nothing to do with its capacity for changing our horizon. This reciprocity works backward as well as forward. Each person whose horizon is affected by the Renaissance affects the horizon of the Renaissance in turn.</div></li><li><div>Any culture that continues to influence our vision continues to grow in the very exercise of that influence.</div></li><li><div>Properly speaking, the Renaissance is not a period but a people, moreover, a people without a boundary, and therefore without an enemy. The Renaissance is not against anyone.</div></li><li><div>A culture is sometimes opposed by suppressing its ideas, its works, even its language. This is a common strategy of a society afraid of the culture growing within its boundaries.</div></li><li><div>But it is a strategy certain to fail, because it confuses the creative activity (poiesis) with the product (poiema) of that activity.</div></li><li><div>Societies characteristically separate the ideas from their thinkers, the poiema from its poietes. A society abstracts its thought and grants power to certain ideas as though they had an existence of their own independent from those who think them, even those who first produced them. In fact, a society is likely to have an idea of itself that no thinker may challenge or revise.</div></li><li><div>Abstracted thought-thought without a thinker-is metaphysics. A society's metaphysics is its ideol-ogy: theories that present themselves as the product of these people or those. The Renaissance had no ideology.</div></li><li><div>A people, as a people, has nothing to defend. In the same way a people has nothing and no one to attack. One cannot be free by opposing another. My freedom does not depend on your loss of freedom. On the contrary, since freedom is never freedom from society, but freedom for it, my freedom inherently affirms yours</div></li><li><div>A people has no enemies.</div></li><li><div>War is not an act of unchecked ruthlessness but a declared contest between bounded societies, or states. If a state has no enemies it has no boundaries.</div></li><li><div>To keep its definitions clear a state must stimulate danger to itself. Under the constant danger of war the people of a state are far more attentive and obedient to the finite structures of their society</div></li><li><div>War presents itself as necessary for self-protection, when in fact it is necessary for self-identification.</div></li><li><div>If it is the impulse of a finite player to go against another nation in war, it is the design of an infinite player to oppose war within a nation.</div></li><li><div>Finite players go to war against states because they endanger bound-aries; infinite players oppose states because they engender boundaries.</div></li><li><div>The strategy of finite players is to kill a state by killing the people who invented it. Infinite players, however, under-standing war to be a conflict between states, conclude that states can have only states as enemies; they cannot have per-sons as enemies.</div></li><li><div>Winning a war can be as destructive as losing one, for if boundaries lose their clarity, as they do in a decisive victory, the state loses its identity. Just as Alexander wept upon learning he had no more enemies to conquer, finite players come to rue their victories unless they see them quickly challenged by new danger.</div></li><li><div>The strategy of infinite players is horizonal. They do not go to meet putative enemies with power and violence, but with poiesis and vision. They invite them to become a people in passage. Infinite players do not rise to meet arms with arms; instead, they make use of laughter, vision, and surprise to engage the state and put its boundaries back into play.</div></li><li><div>What will undo any boundary is the awareness that it is our vision, and not what we are viewing, that is limited.</div></li><li><div>The danger of the poets, for Plato, is that they can imitate so well that it is difficult to see what is true and what is merely invented. Since reality cannot be invented, but only discovered through the exercise of reason-according to Plato-all poets must be put into the service of reason.</div></li><li><div>True poets lead no one unawares. It is nothing other than awareness that poets-that is, creators of all sorts-seek. They do not display their art so as to make it appear real; they display the real in a way that reveals it to be art.</div></li><li><div>We can find metaphysicians thinking, but we cannot find metaphysicians in their thinking</div></li><li><div>Metaphysics is about the real but is abstract. Poetry is the making (poiesis) of the real and is concrete. Whenever what is made (poiema) is separated from the maker (poietes), it becomes metaphysical.</div></li><li><div>the poiema is an object to be studied, not an act to be learned. One cannot learn' an object, but only the poiesis, or the act of creating objects.</div></li><li><div>To separate the poiema from poiesis, the created object from the creative act, is the essence of the theatrical.</div></li><li><div>Poets cannot kill; they die. Metaphysics cannot die; it kills</div></li></ul><li><div>I AM THE GENIUS OF MYSELF</div></li><ul><li><div>I am the genius of myself, the poietes who composes the sentences I speak and the actions I take. It is I, not the mind, that thinks. It is I, not the will, that acts. It is I, not the nervous system, that feels.</div></li><li><div>Since being your own genius is dramatic, it has all the paradox of infinite play: You can have what you have only by releasing it to others. The sounds of the words you speak may lie on your own lips, but if you do not relinquish them entirely to a listener they never become words, and you say nothing at all. The words die with the sound. Spoken to me, your words become mine to do with as I please. As the genius of your words, you lose all authority over them</div></li><li><div>In thinking you cast thoughts beyond themselves, surrendering them to that which they cannot be</div></li><li><div>To speak, or act, or think originally is to erase the boundary of the self. It is to leave behind the territorial personality.</div></li><li><div>A genius does not have a mind full of thoughts but is the thinker of thoughts, and is the center of a field of vision. It is a field of vision, however, that is recognized as a field of vIsion only when we see that it includes within itself the original centers of other fields of vision</div></li><li><div>On the contrary, it is because I cannot see what you see that I can see at all. The discovery that you are the unrepeatable center of your own vision is simultaneous with the discovery that I am the center of my own.</div></li><li><div>As the geniuses we are, we do not look but see.</div></li><li><div>To look at something is to look at it within its limitations.</div></li><li><div>I look at what is marked off, at what stands apart from other things. But things do not have their own limitations. Nothing limits itself.</div></li><li><div>To look at them I must look for what I take them to be.</div></li><li><div>To look at is to look for. It is to bring the limitations with us. "Nature has no outline. Imagination has" (Blake).</div></li><li><div>If to look is to look at what is contained within its limita-tions, to see is to see the limitations themselves</div></li><li><div>Each new school of painting is new not because it now contains subject matter ignored in earlier work, but because it sees the limita-tions previous artists imposed on their subject matter but could not see themselves. The earlier artists worked within the out-lines they imagined; the later reworked their imaginations.</div></li><li><div>To look is a territorial activity. It is to observe one thing after another within a bounded space-as though in time it can all be seen</div></li><li><div>It becomes increasingly diffi-cult to find something new to look at</div></li><li><div>When we pass from looking to seeing, we do not therefore lose our sight of the objects observed. Seeing, in fact, does not disturb our looking at all. It rather places us in that territory as its genius, aware that our imagination does not create within its outlines but creates the outlines themselves</div></li><li><div>To be the genius of myself is not to bring myself into being.</div></li><li><div>I am both the outcome of my past and the transformation of my past.</div></li><li><div>Theatrically, my birth is an e~ent of plotted repetition. I am born as another member of my family and my culture.</div></li><li><div>Dramatically, my birth is the rupture of that repetitive sequence, an event certain to change what the past has meant</div></li><li><div>The drama under way at the time of my birth is moved forward to new possibilities by the appearance of a new genius within it.</div></li><li><div>If I am born into, and add to, the culture of a family, I am also a product and a citizen of its politics</div></li><li><div>It is the genius in us who knows that the past is most definitely past, and therefore not forever sealed but forever open to creative rein-terpretation.</div></li><li><div>Not allowing the past to be past may be the primary source for the seriousness of finite players</div></li><li><div>The finite player, in other words, must not only have an audience but must have an audience to convince.</div></li><li><div>Just as the titles of winners are worthless unless they are visible to others, there is a kind of antititle that attaches to invisibility. To the degree that we are invisible we have a past that has condemned us to oblivion</div></li><li><div>As we enter into finite play-not playfully, but seriously-we come before an audience conscious that we bear the antiti-tles of invisibility. We feel the need, therefore, to prove to them that we are not what we think they think we are or, more precisely, that we were not who we think the audience thinks we were.</div></li><li><div>As finite players we will not enter the game with sufficient desire to win unless we are ourselves convinced by the very audience we intend to convince. That is, unless we believe we actually are the losers the audience sees us to be, we will not have the necessary desire to win</div></li><li><div>The more we are recognized as winners, the more we know ourselves to be losers. That is why it is rare for the winners of highly coveted and publicized prizes to settle for their titles and retire. Winners, especially celebrated winners, must prove repeatedly they are winners. The script must be played over and over again. Titles must be defended by new contests.</div></li><li><div>No one is ever wealthy enough, honored enough, applauded enough. On the contrary, the visibility of our victories only tightens the grip of the failures in our invisible past.</div></li><li><div>There is a humiliating memory at the bottom of all serious conflict</div></li><li><div>These persons do not give us our genius or produce it in us. In no way is the source of genius external to itself; never is a child moved to genius. Genius arises with touch. Touch is a characteristically paradoxical phenomenon of infinite play</div></li><li><div>I am touched only if I respond from my own center-that is, spontaneously, originally. But you do not touch me except from your own center, out of your own genius. Touching is always reciprocal. You cannot touch me unless I touch you in response.</div></li><li><div>The opposite of touching is moving. You move me by press-ing me from without toward a place you have already foreseen and perhaps prepared. It is a staged action that succeeds only if in moving me you remain unmoved yourself</div></li><li><div>When actors bring themselves to tears by their performance, and not as their performance, they have failed their craft; they have become theatrically inept.</div></li><li><div>The finite player's interest is not in being healed, or made whole, but in being cured, or made functional. Healing restores me to play, curing restores me to competition in one or another game.</div></li><li><div>Physicians who cure must abstract persons into functions.</div></li><li><div>They-treat the illness, not the person. And persons willfully present themselves as functions. Indeed, what sustains the enormous size and cost of the curing professions is the wide-spread desire to see oneself as a function, or a collection of functions</div></li><li><div>To be ill is to be dysfunctional; to be dysfunctional is to be unable to cbmpete in one's preferred contests. It is a kind of death, an inability to acquire titles. The ill become invisible. Illness always has the smell of death about it: Either it may lead to death, or it leads to the death of a person as competitor. The dread of illness is the dread of losing.</div></li><li><div>One is never ill in general. One is always ill with relation to some bounded activity. It is not cancer that makes me ill. I t is because I cannot work, or run, or swallow that I am ill with cancer. The loss of function, the obstruction of an activity, cannot in itself destroy my health. I am too heavy to fly by flapping my arms, but I do not for that reason com-plain of being sick with weight</div></li><li><div>When I am healed I am restored to my center in -a way that my freedom as a person is not compromised by my loss of functions. This means that the illness need not be elimi-nated before I can be healed. I am not free to the degree that I can overcome my infirmities, but only to the degree that I can put my infirmities into play.</div></li><li><div>Sexuality for the infinite player is entirely a matter of touch.</div></li><li><div>One cannot touch without touching sexually.</div></li><li><div>Because sexuality is a drama of origins, it gives full expression to the genius you are and to the genius of others who partici-pate in that drama</div></li><li><div>Aware that genuine sexual expression is at least as dangerous to society as genuine artistic expression, the sexual metaphysician can appeal to at least two powerful solutions. One is to treat sexuality as a process of reproduction;</div></li><li><div>another is to place it in the area of feeling and behavior</div></li><li><div>Although reproduction is a process that operates by way of our bodies, it nonetheless operates autonomously. Like every other natural process it is a phenomenon of causal continuity, having no inherent beginning or end. Therefore we cannot be said to initiate the process by any act of our own</div></li><li><div>The second way of veiling genuine sexuality is to regard it as a feeling or as a kind of behavior. In either case it has the character of something under observation</div></li><li><div>We ask ourselves and each other whether certain behavior is acceptable or desirable; we are puzzled over the proper response to sexual feelings--ours or another's. Sexuality can in this way be dealt with as a societal phenomenon, regulated and managed according to the prevail-ing ideology</div></li><li><div>Sexual plotting on the part of one player is in fact stimulated by disinterest or fear or loathing on the part of the other.</div></li><li><div>A Master Player of finite sexuality chooses not to take these attitudes as a way of refusing the sexual game, but takes them to be part of the game. Thus my indifference or revulsion to your sexuality becomes in your masterful playa sexual indif-ference, a sexual revulsion. Suddenly I am no longer indifferent to your game, but indifferent to you within your game, and have ipso facto made myself your opponent.</div></li><li><div>The profound seriousness of such sexual play is seen in the unique nature of the prize that goes to the winner. What one wants in the sexual contest is not just to have defeated the other, but to have the defeated other. Sexuality is the only finite game in which the winner's prize is the defeated opponent.</div></li><li><div>Insofar as sexuality is a drama of origin it is original to society and not derivative of it. It is therefore somewhat mis-leading to describe society as a regulator of finite sexual play.</div></li><li><div>It is more the case that finite sexuality shapes society than is shaped by it. Only to a limited extent do we take on the sexual roles assigned us by society. Much more frequently we enter into societal arrangements by way of sexual roles.</div></li><li><div>(For example, we are more likely to refer to the king as the father of the country than we are to refer to the father as king of the family.)</div></li><li><div>This means that society plays little or no role in either causing or preventing sexual tensions. On the contrary, society absorbs sexual tensions into all of its structures. It becomes the larger theater for playing out the patterns of resentment learned in the family. Society is where we prove to parents qua audience that we are not what we thought they thought we were.</div></li><li><div>Since sexuality is the only finite game in which the winner's prize is the loser, the most desirable form of property is the publicly acknowledged possession of another's person, a rela-tionship to which the possessed must of course freely consent.</div></li><li><div>All other forms of property are considerably less desirable, even when they are vast in quantity.</div></li><li><div>The most serious struggles are those for sexual property.</div></li><li><div>For this wars are fought, lives are generously risked, great schemes are initiated. However, who wins empire, fortune, and fame but loses in love has lost in everything.</div></li><li><div>Because finite, or veiled, sexuality is one or another struggle which its participants mean to win, it is oriented toward mo-ments, outcomes, final scenes. Like all finite play it proceeds largely by deception</div></li><li><div>Sexual desires are usually not directly announced but concealed under a series of feints, gestures, styles of dress, and showy behavior. Seductions are staged, scripted, costumed. Certain responses are sought, plots are developed. In skillful seductions delays are employed, special circumstances and settings are arranged.</div></li><li><div>Seductions are designed to come to an end. Time runs out. The play is finished. All that remains is recollection, the memory of a moment, and perhaps a longing for its repetition.</div></li><li><div>Seductions cannot be repeated.</div></li><li><div>Moments once reached cannot be reached again. Lovers often sustain vivid reminders of extraordinary moments, but they are reminded at the same time of their impotence in recreating them.</div></li><li><div>By contrast, infinite players have no interest in seduction or in restricting the freedom of another to one's own bound-aries of play. Infinite players recognize choice in all aspects of sexuality.</div></li><li><div>Who chooses. to compete with an-other can also choose to play with another.</div></li><li><div>Sexuality is not a bounded phenomenon but a horizonal phenomenon for infinite players. One can never say, therefore, that an infinite player is homosexual, or heterosexual, or celi-bate, or adulterous, or faithful-because each of these defini-tions has to do with boundaries, with circumscribed areas and styles of play.</div></li><li><div>Suffering others, they open themselves. Open, they learn both about others and about themselves.</div></li><li><div>What they learn is not about sexuality, but how to be more concretely and originally themselves, to be the genius of their own actions, to be whole.</div></li><li><div>There is nothing hidden in infinite sexuality. Sexual desire is exposed as sexual desire and is never therefore serious. Its satisfaction is never an achievement, but an act in a continuing relationship, and therefore joyous. Its lack of satisfaction is never a failure, but only a matter to be taken on into further play.</div></li><li><div>Infinite lovers mayor may not have a family.</div></li><li><div>Families can convene only out of choice. The family of infinite lovers has this difference, that it is self-evi-dently chosen. It is a progressive work of unveiling. Fathering and mothering are roles freely assumed but always with the design of showing them to be theatrical. It is the intention of parents in such families to make it plain to their children that they all play cultural and not societal roles, that they are only roles, and that they are all truly concrete persons behind them. Therefore, children also learn that they have a family only by choosing to have it, by a collective act to be a family with each other.</div></li><li><div>Infinite sexuality does not focus its attention on certain parts or regions of the body. Infinite lovers have no "private parts." They do not regard their bodies as having secret zones that can be exposed or made accessible to others for special favors. It is not their bodies but their persons they make accessible to others.</div></li><li><div>The triumph of finite sexuality is to be liberated from play into the body. The essence of infinite sexuality is to be liberated into play with the body. In finite sexuality I expect to relate to you as a body; in infinite sexuality I expect to relate to you in your body.</div></li></ul><li><div>A FINITE GAME OCCURS WITHIN A WORLD</div></li><ul><li><div>A finite game occurs within a world. The fact that it must be limited temporally, numerically, and spatially means that there is something against which the limits stand. There is an outside to every finite game. Its limits are meaningless unless there is something to be limited, unless there is a larger space, a longer time, a greater number of possible competitors.</div></li><li><div>There is nothing about a finite game, in itself, that deter-mines at what time it is to be played, or by whom, or where.</div></li><li><div>A world provides an absolute reference without which the time, place, and participants make no sense.</div></li><li><div>Whatever occurs within a game is relatively intelligible with reference to whatever else has happened inside its boundaries, but it is absolutely intelligible with reference to that world for the sake of which its boundaries exist.</div></li><li><div>It is relatively intelligible to have won an election for the presidency by a few thousand votes after a campaign of about ten months; it is absolutely intelligible to be the sixteenth President of the United States, a society unambiguously marked off from all the rest of the world by its declared bound-aries, in the 1,860th year of that world's history</div></li><li><div>We cannot have a precise understanding of what it means to be the winner of a contest until we can place the game in the absolute dimensions of a world.</div></li><li><div>World exists in the form of audience.</div></li><li><div>An audience consists of persons observing a contest without participating in it.</div></li><li><div>No one determines who an audience will be. No exercise of power can make a world. A world must be its own spontane-ous source.</div></li><li><div>An audience does not receive its identity according to the persons within it, but according to the events it observes</div></li><li><div>The fact that a finite game needs an audience before which it can be played, and the fact that an audience needs to be singularly absorbed in the events before it, show the crucial reciprocity of finite play and the world. Finite players need the world to provide an absolute reference for understanding themselves; simultaneously, the world needs the theater of finite play to remain a world</div></li><li><div>There is an indefinite number of worlds.</div></li><li><div>Because the seriousness of finite play derives from the players' need to correct another's putative assessment of themselves, there is no requirement that the audience be physically present, since players are al-ready their own audience.</div></li><li><div>When suffi-ciently oblivious to their status as audience, the observers of a finite game become so absorbed in its conduct that they lose the sense of distance between themselves and the players.</div></li><li><div>It is they, quite as much as the players, who win or lose.</div></li><li><div>For this reason the audience absorbs in itself the same politics of resentment that moves players to show they are not what they think others think they are. The audience is under the same constraint to disprove this judgment.</div></li><li><div>Occurring before a world, theatrically, a finite game occurs within time. Because it has its boundaries, its beginning and end, within the absolute temporal limits established by a world, time for a finite player runs out; it is used up</div></li><li><div>A finite game does not have its own time. It exists in a world's time. An audience allows players only so much time to win their titles.</div></li><li><div>Early in a game time seems abundant, and there appears a greater freedom to develop future strategies. Late in a game, time is rapidly being consumed. As choices become more lim-ited they become more important. Errors are more disastrous</div></li><li><div>The errors of childhood can be more easily amended than those of adulthood.</div></li><li><div>For the finite player in us freedom is a function of time.</div></li><li><div>We must have time to be free.</div></li><li><div>The passage of time is always relative to that which does not pass, to the timeless. Victories occur in time, but the titles won in them are timeless. Titles neither age nor die.</div></li><li><div>Time divided into periods is theatrical time. The lapse of time between the opening and closing of an era is a scene between curtains. It is not a time lived, but a time viewed-by both players and audience. The periodization of time pre-supposes a viewer existing outside the boundaries of play, able to see the beginning and the end simultaneously</div></li><li><div>The outcome of a finite game is the past waiting to happen.</div></li><li><div>Whoever plays toward a certain outcome desires a particular past. By competing for a future prize, finite players compete for a prized past.</div></li><li><div>The infinite player in us does not consume time but gener-ates it. Because infinite play is dramatic and has no scripted conclusion, its time is time lived and not time viewed.</div></li><li><div>As an infinite player one is neither young nor old, for one does not live in the time of another.</div></li><li><div>Time does not pass for an infinite player. Each moment of time is a beginning.</div></li><li><div>Each moment is not the beginning of a period of time.</div></li><li><div>For an infinite player there is no such thing as an hour of time. There can be an hour of love, or a day of grieving, or a season of learning, or a period of labor.</div></li><li><div>Work is not an infinite player's way of passing time, but of engendering possibility. Work is not a way of arriving at a desired present and securing it against an unpredictable future, but of moving toward a future which itself has a future.</div></li><li><div>Infinite players cannot say how much they have completed in their work or love or quarreling, but only that much remains incomplete in it. They are not concerned to determine when it is over, but only what comes of it.</div></li><li><div>For the finite player in us freedom is a function of time.</div></li><li><div>We must have the time to be free. For the infinite player in us time is a function of freedom. We are free to have time. A finite player puts play into time. An infinite player puts time into play.</div></li><li><div>Infinite play remains invisible to the finite observer. Such viewers are looking for closure, for the ways in which players can bring matters to a conclusion and finish whatever remains unfinished. They are looking for the way time has exhausted itself, or will soon do so. Finite players stand before infinite playas they stand before art, looking at it, making a poiema of it.</div></li><li><div>If, however, the observers see the poiesis in the work they cease at once being observers. They find themselves in its time, aware that it remains unfinished, aware that their reading of the poetry is itself poetry. Infected then by the genius of the artist they recover their own genius, becoming beginners with nothing but possibility ahead of them.</div></li><li><div>If the goal of finite play is to win titles for their timelessness, and thus eternal life for oneself, the essence of infinite play is the paradoxical engagement with temporality that Meister Eckhart called "eternal birth."</div></li></ul><li><div>NATURE Is THE REALM OF THE UNSPEAKABLE</div></li><ul><li><div>Nature is the realm of the unspeakable. It has no voice of its own, and nothing to say. We experien~e the unspeakability of nature as its utter indifference to human culture.</div></li><li><div>If nature will offer us no home, offer us nothing at all, we will then clear and arrange a space for ourselves. We take nature on as an opponent to be subdued for the sake of civilization. We count among the highest achievements of modern society the development of a technol-ogy that allows us to master nature's vagaries.</div></li><li><div>What we have done by showing that certain events repeat themselves according to known laws is to explain them. Expla-nation is the mode of discourse in which we show why matters must be as they are. All laws made use of in explanation look backward in time from the, conclusion or the completion of a sequence. It is implicit in all explanatory discourse that just as there is a discoverable necessity in the outcome of past events, there is a discoverable necessity in future events.</div></li><li><div>What can be explained can also be predicted, if one knows the initial events and the laws covering their succession. A prediction is but an explanation in advance.</div></li><li><div>Because of its thorough lawfulness nature has no genius of its own. On the contrary, it is sometimes thought that the grandest discovery of the human genius is the perfect compatibility between the structure of the natural order and the structure of the mind, thereby making a complete under-standing of nature possible</div></li><li><div>By presuming to speak for the unspeakable, by hearing our own voice as the voice of nature, we have had to step outside the circle of nature. It is one thing for physics and chemistry to be speaking about nature; it is quite another for physics and chemistry to be the speaking of nature</div></li><li><div>What we learn from this silence is the unlikeness between nature and whatever we could think or say about it. But this silence has an irony of its own: Far from stupefying us, it provides an indispensable condition to the mind's own originality. By confronting us with radical unlikeness, nature becomes the source of metaphor.</div></li><li><div>Metaphor is the joining of like to unlike such that one can never become the other. Metaphor requires an irreducibil-ity, an imperturbable indifference of its terms for one another</div></li><li><div>At its root all language has the character of metaphor, be-cause no matter what it intends to be about it remains lan-guage, and remains absolutely unlike whatever it is about.</div></li><li><div>The unspeakability of nature is the very possibility of lan-guage.</div></li><li><div>Our attempt to take control of nature, to be Master Player in our opposition to it, is an attempt to rid ourselves of lan-guage. It is the refusal to accept nature as "nature." It is to deafen ourselves to metaphor, and to make nature into some-thing so familiar it is essentially an extension of our willing and speaking.</div></li><li><div>If nature is the realm of the unspeakable, history is the realm of the speakable.</div></li><li><div>Like explanation, narrative is concerned with a sequence of events and brings its tale to a conclusion. However, there is no general law that makes this outcome necessary. In a genuine story there is no law that makes any act necessary.</div></li><li><div>Explanations place all apparent possibilities into the context of the necessary; stories set all necessities into the context of the possible</div></li><li><div>Explanation can tolerate a degree of chance, but it cannot comprehend freedom at all. We explain nothing when we say that persons do whatever they do because they choose to do it.</div></li><li><div>On the other hand, causation cannot find a place in narrative. We have not told a story when we show that persons do whatever they do because they were caused to do it-by their genes, their social circumstances, or the influ-ence of the gods.</div></li><li><div>Explanations settle issues, showing that matters must end as they have. Narratives raise issues, showing that matters do not end as they must but as they do. Explanation sets the need for further inquiry aside; narrative invites us to rethink what we thought we knew</div></li><li><div>Successful explanations do not draw attention to themselves as modes of speaking, because what is explained is not itself subject to history.</div></li><li><div>The explanation is true anywhere and any time.</div></li><li><div>That I choose to explain this to you in this time and place, however, is historical; it is an event-the narrative of our relation with each other. There must therefore be a reason for the speaking of this verity</div></li><li><div>True conversions con-sist in the choice of a new audience, that is, of a new world.</div></li><li><div>All that was once familiar is now seen in startlingly new ways</div></li><li><div>Explanations succeed only by convincing resistant hearers of their error. If you will not hear my explanations until you are suspicious of your own truths, you will not accept my explanations until you are convinced of your error. Explanation is an antagonistic encounter that succeeds by defeating an opponent. It possesses the same dynamic of resentment found in other finite play.</div></li><li><div>Whoever wins this struggle is privileged with the claim to true knowledge. Knowledge has been arrived at, it is the outcome of this engagement. Its winners have the uncontested power to make certain statements of fact. They are to be listened to.</div></li><li><div>Knowledge, therefore, is like property. It must be published, declared, or in some other way so displayed that others cannot but take account of it. It must stand in their way. It must be emblematic, pointing backward at its possessor's competi-tive skill.</div></li><li><div>Those who are entitled to knowl-edge feel they should be granted property as well, and those who are entitled to property believe a certain knowledge goes with it.</div></li><li><div>What one wins in a title is the privilege of magisterial speech. The privilege of magisterial speech is the highest honor attaching to any title. We expect the first act of a winner to be a speech. The first act of the loser may also be a speech, but it will be a speech to concede victory, to declare there will be no further challenge to the winner. It is a speech that promises to silence the loser's voice.</div></li><li><div>The silence to which the losers pledge themselves is the silence of obedience. Losers have nothing to say; nor have they an audience who would listen</div></li><li><div>The victorious do not speak with the defeated; they speak for the defeated. Husbands speak for wives in the finite family, and parents for their children. Kings speak for the realm, governors for the state, popes for the church. Indeed, the titled, as titled, cannot speak with anyone.</div></li><li><div>It is chiefly in magisterial speech that the power of winners resides. To be powerful is to have one's words obeyed. It is only by magisterial speech that the emblematic property of winners can be safeguarded</div></li><li><div>The power of gods is known principally through their utter-ances.</div></li><li><div>The speech of a god can be so perfectly expressive of that god's power that the god and its speech become identical: "In the beginning was the word.</div></li><li><div>The word was with God, and the word was God."</div></li><li><div>To lose a contest is to become obedient; to become obedient is to lose one's listeners. The silence of obedience is an unheard silence. It is the silence of death. For this reason the demand for obedience is inherently evil.</div></li><li><div>The silence of nature is the possibility of language. By subdu-ing nature the gods give it their own voice, but in making nature an opponent they make all their listeners opponents.</div></li><li><div>By refusing the silence of nature they demand the silence of obedience. The unspeakability of nature is therefore trans-formed into the unspeakability of language itself.</div></li><li><div>Infinite speech is that mode of discourse that consistently reminds us of the unspeakability of nature. It bears no claim to truth, originating from nothing but the genius of the speaker. Infinite speech is therefore not about anything; it is always to someone. I t is not command, but address. 1t belongs entirely to the speakable.</div></li><li><div>Metaphor is horizonal, reminding us that it is one's vision that is limited, and not what one is viewing.</div></li><li><div>The meaning of a finite speaker's discourse lies in what precedes its utterance, what is already the case and therefore is the case whether or not it is spoken.</div></li><li><div>The meaning of an infinite speaker's discourse lies in what comes of its utterance-that is, whatever is the case because it is spoken.</div></li><li><div>Finite language exists complete before it is spoken. There is first a language-then we learn to speak it. Infinite language exists only as it is spoken. There is first a language-when we learn to speak it. It is in this sense that infinite discourse always arises from a perfect silence.</div></li><li><div>Finite speakers come to speech with their voices already trained and rehearsed. They must know what they are doing with the language before they can speak it. Infinite speakers must wait to see what is done with their language by the listeners before they can know what they have said</div></li><li><div>Because it is address, attending always on the response of the addressed, infinite speech has the form of listening. Infinite speech does not end in the obedient silence of the hearer, but continues by way of the attentive silence of the speaker.</div></li><li><div>It is not a silence into which speech has died, but a silence from which speech is born.</div></li><li><div>Infinite speakers do not give voice to another, but receive it from another. Infinite speakers do not therefore appeal to a world as audience, do not speak before a world, but present themselves as an audience by way of talking with others</div></li><li><div>Finite speech informs another about the world-for the sake of being heard. Infinite speech forms a world about the other-for the sake of listening</div></li><li><div>A god cannot create a world and be magisterial within it.</div></li><li><div>A god can create a world only by listening.</div></li><li><div>Were the gods to address us it would not be to bring us to silence through their speech, but to bring us to speech through their silence.</div></li><li><div>The contradiction of finite speech is that it must end by being heard. The paradox of infinite speech is that it continues only because it is a way of listening. Finite speech ends with a silence of closure. Infinite speech begins with a disclosure of silence.</div></li><li><div>Storytellers do not convert their listeners; they do not move them into the territory of a superior truth. Ignoring the issue of truth and falsehood altogether, they offer only vision. Story-telling is therefore not combative; it does not succeed or fail.</div></li><li><div>A story cannot be obeyed. Instead of placing one body of knowledge against another, storytellers invite us to return from knowledge to thinking, from a bounded way of looking to an horizonal way of seeing.</div></li><li><div>Storytellers enter the historical not when their speaking is full of anecdotes about actual persons, or when they appear as characters in their own tales, but when in their speaking we begin to see the narrative character of OUT lives. The stories they tell touch us.</div></li><li><div>Fate arises not as a limitation on our freedom, but as a manifestation of our freedom, testimony that choice is consequent. The exercise of your freedom cannot prevent the exercise of my own freedom, but it can determine the context in which I am to act freely. You cannot make choices for me, but you can largely determine what my choices will be about</div></li><li><div>True storytellers do not know their own story. What they listen to in their poiesis is the disclosure that wherever there is closure there is the possibility of a new opening, that they do not die at the end, but in the course of play</div></li></ul><li><div>WE CONTROL NATURE FOR SOCIETAL REASONS</div></li><ul><li><div>We control nature for societal reasons. The control of nature advances with our ability to predict the outcome of natural processes. Inasmuch as predictions are but explanations in reverse, it is possible that they will be quite as combative as explanations. Indeed, prediction is the most highly devel-oped skill of the Master Player, for without it control of an opponent is all the more difficult. I t follows that our domina-tion of nature is meant to achieve not certain natural outcomes, but certain societal outcomes.</div></li><li><div>we can exercise power over nature, but that our attempt to do so masks our desire for power over each other</div></li><li><div>The alternative attitudes toward nature can be characterized in a rough way by saying that the result of approaching nature as a hostile Other whose designs are basically inimical to our interests is the machine, while the result of learning to disci-pline ourselves to consist with the deepest discernable patterns of natural order is the garden.</div></li><li><div>"Machine" is used here as inclusive of technology and not as an example of it-as a way of drawing attention to the mechanical rationality of technology.</div></li><li><div>To garden is not to engage in a hobby or an amusement; it is to design a culture capable of adjusting to the widest possible range of surprise in nature. Gardeners are acutely attentive to the deep patterns of natural order, but are also aware that there will always be much lying beyond their vision. Gardening is a horizonal activ-ity.</div></li><li><div>Machine and garden are not absolutely opposed to each other. Machinery can exist in the garden quite as finite games can be played within an infinite game. The question is not one of restricting machines from the garden but asking whether a machine serves the interest of the garden, or the liB garden the interest of the machine. We are familiar with a kind of mechanized gardening that has the appearance of high productivity, but looking closely we can see that what is intended is not the encouragement of natural spontaneity but its harnessing.</div></li><li><div>The most elemental difference between the machine and the garden is that one is driven by a force which must be introduced from without, the other grown by an energy which originates from within itself.</div></li><li><div>no machine has been made, nor can one be made, that has the source of its spontaneity within itself. A machine must be designed, constructed, and fueled.</div></li><li><div>no way has been found, or can be found, by which organic growth can be forced from without. The application of fertilizers, herbicides, and any number of other substances does not alter growth but allows growth; it is meant to consist with natural growth. A plant cannot be designed or constructed. Though we seem to give it "fuel" in the form of rich earth and appropri-ate nutrients, we depend on the plant to make use of the fuel by way of its own vitality</div></li><li><div>A machine depends on its designer and its operator both for the supply of fuel and its consumption. A machine has not the merest trace of its own spontaneity or vitality. Vitality cannot be given, only found</div></li><li><div>Our freedom in relation to nature is not the freedom to change nature; it is not the possession of power over natural phenomena. It is the freedom to change ourselves. We are perfectly free to design a culture that will turn on the awareness that vitality cannot be given but only found, that the given patterns of spontaneity in nature are not only to be respected, but to be celebrated.</div></li><li><div>Nature's source of movement is always from within itself;</div></li><li><div>indeed it is itself. And it is radically distinct from our own source of movement. This is not to say that, possessing no order, nature is chaotic. It is neither chaotic nor ordered.</div></li><li><div>Chaos and order describe the cultural experience of nature-the degree to which nature's indifferent spontaneity seems to agree with our current manner of cultural self-control.</div></li><li><div>The paradox in our relation to nature is that the more deeply a culture respects the indifference of nature, the more creatively it will call upon its own spontaneity in response.</div></li><li><div>The more clearly we remind ourselves that we can have no unnatural influence on nature, the more our culture will embody a freedom to embrace surprise and unpredictabil-ity.</div></li><li><div>Human freedom is not a freedom over nature; it is the freedom to be natural, that is, to answer to the spontaneity of nature with our own spontaneity. Though we are free to be natural, we are not free by nature; we are free by culture, by history</div></li><li><div>The contradiction in our relation to nature is that the more vigorously we attempt to force its agreement with our own designs the more subject we are to its indifference, the more vulnerable to its unseeing forces. The more power we exercise over natural process the more powerless we become before it. In a matter of months we can cut down a rain forest that took tens of thousands of years to grow, but we are helpless in repulsing the desert that takes its place. And the desert, of course, is no less natural than the forest.</div></li><li><div>All ma-chines, and especially very complicated machines, require oper-ators to place themselves in a provided location and to perform functions mechanically adapted to the functions of the ma-chine. To use the machine for control is to be controlled by the machine.</div></li><li><div>To operate a machine one must operate like a machine.</div></li><li><div>Using a machine to do what we cannot do, we find we must do what the machine does.</div></li><li><div>There is no style in operating a machine. The more efficient the machine, the more it either limits or absorbs our unique-ness into its operation.</div></li><li><div>Just as we use machinery against ourselves, we also use machinery against itself. A machine is not a way of doing something; it stands in the way of doing something.</div></li><li><div>When we use machines to achieve whatever it is we desire, we cannot have what we desire until we have finished with the machine, until we can rid ourselves of the mechanical means of reaching our intended outcome. The goal of technol-ogy is therefore to eliminate itself, to become silent, invisible, carefree.</div></li><li><div>We do not purchase an automobile, for example, merely to own some machinery. Indeed, it is not machinery we are buying at all, but what we can have by way of it: a means of rapidly carrying us from one location to another, an object of envy for others, protection from the weather.</div></li><li><div>the importance of reducing time in travel: by arriving as quickly as possible we need not feel as though we had left at all, that neither space nor time can affect us-as though they belong to us, and not we to them</div></li><li><div>When most effective, the technology of communication allows us to bring the histories and the experiences of others into our home, but without changing our home. When most effective, the technology of travel allows us to pass through the histories of other persons with the "comforts of home," but without changing those histories.</div></li><li><div>When it is most effective, machinery will have no effect at all.</div></li><li><div>Using it against itself and against ourselves, we also use machinery against each other.</div></li><li><div>If to operate a machine is to operate like a machine, then we not only operate with each other like machines, we operate each other like machines. And if a machine is most effective when it has no effect, then we operate each other in such a way that we reach the outcome desired-in such a way that nothing happens.</div></li><li><div>Weapons are the equipment of finite games designed in such a way that they do not maximize the play but eliminate it. Weapons are meant not to win contests but to end them. Killers are not victors; they are unopposed competitors, players without a game, living contradictions.</div></li><li><div>If indifference to nature leads to the machine, the indiffer-ence of nature leads to the garden. All culture has the form of gardening: the encouragement of spontaneity in others by way of one's own, the respect for source, and the refusal to convert source into resource.</div></li><li><div>While machinery is meant to work changes without chang-ing its operators, gardening transforms its workers. One learns how to drive a car, one learns to drive as a car; but one becomes a gardener.</div></li><li><div>Gardening is not outcome-oriented. A successful harvest is not the end of a garden's existence, but only a phase of it. As any gardener knows, the vitality of a garden does not end with a harvest. It simply takes another form. Gardens do not "die" in the winter but quietly prepare for another season.</div></li><li><div>Growth promotes growth.</div></li><li><div>So also in culture. Infinite players understand that the vigor of a culture has to do with the variety of its sources, the differences within itself. The unique and the surprising are not suppressed in some persons for the strength of others.</div></li><li><div>The genius in you stimulates the genius in me.</div></li><li><div>Inasmuch as gardens do not conclude with a harvest and are not played for a certain outcome, one never arrives any-where with a garden</div></li><li><div>A garden is a place where growth is found. It has its own source of change. One does not bring change to a garden, but comes to a garden prepared for change, and therefore prepared to change. It is possible to deal with growth only out of growth.</div></li><li><div>Genuine travel has no destination. Travelers do not go some-where, but constantly discover they are somewhere else.</div></li><li><div>All travel is there-fore change within the traveler, and it is for that reason that travelers are always somewhere else. To travel is to grow.</div></li><li><div>The only true voyage would be not to travel through a hundred different lands with the same pair of eyes, but to see the same land through a hundred different pairs of eyes" {Proust}.</div></li><li><div>waste is not the result of what we have made. It is what we have made. Waste plutonium is not an indirect consequence of the nuclear indus-try; it is a product of that industry.</div></li><li><div>Because waste is unveiling, it is not only placed out of sight, it is declared a kind of antiproperty. No one owns it.</div></li><li><div>Part of the contradiction in the phenomenon of waste is that treating nature as though it belongs to us we must soon treat nature as though it belongs to no one. Not only does no one own waste, no one wants it. Instead of competing to possess these particular products, we compete to dispossess them. We force it on others less able to rid themselves of it.</div></li><li><div>Waste is the antiproperty that becomes the possession of losers. It is the emblem of the untitled</div></li><li><div>Since the attempt to control nature is at its heart the at-tempt to control other persons, we can expect societies to be less patient with those cultures which express some degree of indifference to societal goals and values. I t is this repeated parallel that brings us to see that the society that creates natural waste creates human waste</div></li></ul><li><div>MYTH PROVOKES EXPLANATION BUT ACCEPTS NONE Of IT</div></li><li><div>The very liveliness of a culture is determined not by how fre-quently these thinkers discover new continents of knowledge but by how frequently they depart to seek them.</div></li><li><div>A culture can be no stronger than its strongest myths.</div></li><li><div>A story attains the status of myth when it is retold, and persistently retold, solely for its own sake.</div></li><li><div>If I tell a story as a way of bracing up an argument or amusing an audience, I am not telling it for its own sake.</div></li><li><div>To tell a story for its own sake is to tell it for no other reason than that it is a story</div></li><li><div>Great stories have this feature: To listen to them and learn them is to become their narrators.</div></li><li><div>Our first response to hearing a story is the desire to tell it ourselves-the greater the story the greater the desire</div></li><li><div>As myths make individual experience possible, they also make collective experience possible. Whole civilizations rise from stories-and can rise from nothing else.</div></li><li><div>Myths, told for their own sake, are not stories that have meanings, but stories that give meanings</div></li><li><div>Storytellers become metaphysicians, or ideologists, when they come to believe they know the entire story of a people</div></li><li><div>We resonate with myth when it resounds in us. A myth resounds in me when its voice is heard in mine but not heard as mine</div></li><li><div>Myths of irrepressible resonance have lost all trace of an author.</div></li><li><div>No myth, therefore, exists by itself; neither does it have a discoverable origin</div></li><li><div>myth is the highest form of our listening to each other, of offering a silence that makes the speech of the other possible. This is why listening is far more valued by religion than speaking. Fides ex auditu. Faith comes by listening, Paul said.</div></li><li><div>The opposite of resonance is amplification. A choir is the unified expression of voices resonating with each other; a loud-speaker is the amplification of a single voice, excluding all others. A bell resonates, a cannon amplifies. We listen to the bell, we are silenced by the cannon</div></li><li><div>When a single voice is sufficiently amplified, it becomes a speaking that makes it impossible for any other voices to be heard. We do not listen to a loudspeaker for what is being said, but only because it is all that is being said. Magisterial speech is amplified speech; it is speech that silences. Loud-speaking is a mode of command, and therefore a speech de-signed to bring itself to an end as completely and swiftly as possible. The amplified voice seeks obedient action on the part of its hearers and an immediate end to their speech.</div></li><li><div>There is no possibility of conversation with a loudspeaker.</div></li><li><div>If it is true that myth provokes explanation, then it is also true that explanation's ultimate design is to eliminate myth.</div></li><li><div>It is not just that the availability of bells in churches and town halls of Europe makes it possible to forge new cannon;</div></li><li><div>it is that the cannon are forged in order to silence the bells.</div></li><li><div>This is the contradiction of finite play in its highest form:</div></li><li><div>to play in such a way that all need for play is erased.</div></li><li><div>The loudspeaker, successfully muting all other voices and therefore all possibility of conversation, is not listened to at all, and for that reason loses its own voice and becomes mere noise. Whenever we succeed in being the only speaker, there is no speaker at all.</div></li><li><div>Myths that cannot be forgotten are those so resonant with the paradox of silence they become the source of our thinking, even our culture, and our civilization.</div></li>

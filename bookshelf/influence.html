And an isolated piece of information, even though it normally counsels us correctly, can lead us to clearly stupid mistakes. We employ the factors of reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity so often and so automatically in making decisions.">

          <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><div>Chapter 1: WEAPONS OF INFLUENCE</div></li><ul><li><div>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. —ALBERT EINSTEIN</div></li><li><div>Fixed-action patterns: A fundamental characteristic of these patterns is that the behaviors that compose them occur in virtually the same fashion and in the same order every time.</div></li><li><div>A well-known principle of human behavior says that <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I’m in a rush? The effectiveness of this request-plus-reason was nearly total: Ninety-four percent of those asked let her skip ahead of them in line. Compare this success rate to the results when she made the request only: Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine? Under those circumstances, only 60 percent of those asked complied.</div></li><li><div>Instead of including a real reason for compliance, Langer’s third type of request used the word “because” and then, adding nothing new, merely restated the obvious: Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies? The result was that once again nearly all (93 percent) agreed, even though no real reason, no new information, was added to justify their compliance.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Automatic, stereotyped behavior is prevalent in much of human action, because in many cases it is the most efficient form of behaving, and in other cases it is simply necessary.</span> You and I exist in an extraordinarily complicated stimulus environment, easily the most rapidly moving and complex that has ever existed on this planet. To deal with it, we need shortcuts.</div></li><ul><li><div>The renowned British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead recognized this inescapable quality of modern life when he asserted that “civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.”</div></li><li><div>They make us terribly vulnerable to anyone who does know how they work.</div></li></ul><li><div>This last feature of the process allows the exploiters an enormous additional benefit—<span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">the ability to manipulate without the appearance of manipulation</span>. Even the victims themselves tend to see their compliance as determined by the action of natural forces rather than by the designs of the person who profits from that compliance.</div></li><ul><li><div>There is a principle in human perception, <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">the contrast principle, that affects the way we see the difference between two things that are presented one after another</span>. Simply put, if the second item is fairly different from the first, we will tend to see it as more different than it actually is. So if we lift a light object first and then lift a heavy object, we will estimate the second object to be heavier than if we had lifted it without first trying the light one. The contrast principle is well established in the field of psychophysics and applies to all sorts of perceptions besides weight. If we are talking to a beautiful woman at a cocktail party and are then joined by an unattractive one, the second woman will strike us as less attractive than she actually is.</div></li><li><div>Sell the suit first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensive ones, their prices will not seem as high in comparison. A man might balk at the idea of spending $95 for a sweater, but if he has just bought a $495 suit, a $95 sweater does not seem excessive.</div></li><li><div>“The interesting thing is that even when a man enters a clothing store with the express purpose of purchasing a suit, he will almost always pay more for whatever accessories he buys if he buys them after the suit purchase than before.”</div></li><li><div>Presenting an inexpensive product first and following it with an expensive one will cause the expensive item to seem even more costly as a result—hardly a desirable consequence for most sales organizations.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Surprise is an effective compliance producer in its own right. People who are surprised by a request will often comply because they are momentarily unsure of themselves and, consequently, influenced easily.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter 2: RECIPROCATION</div></li><ul><li><div>Pay every debt, as if God wrote the bill.—RALPH WALDO EMERSON</div></li><li><div>Rule for reciprocation: The rule says that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.</div></li><li><div>The Rule Is Overpowering</div></li><ul><li><div>The rule for reciprocity was so strong that it simply overwhelmed the influence of a factor—liking for the requester—that normally affects the decision to comply.</div></li></ul><li><div>The Rule Enforces Uninvited Debts</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Another person can trigger a feeling of indebtedness by doing us an uninvited favor.</span></div></li><li><div>The rule was established to promote the development of reciprocal relationships between individuals so that one person could initiate such a relationship without the fear of loss. If the rule is to serve that purpose, then, an uninvited first favor must have the ability to create an obligation.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Although the obligation to repay constitutes the essence of the reciprocity rule, it is the obligation to receive that makes the rule so easy to exploit. The obligation to receive reduces our ability to choose whom we wish to be indebted to and puts that power in the hands of others.</span></div></li><li><div>There is a strong cultural pressure to reciprocate a gift, even an unwanted one; but there is no such pressure to purchase an unwanted commercial product.</div></li></ul><li><div>The Rule Can Trigger Unfair Exchanges</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The rule demands that one sort of action be reciprocated with a similar sort of action.</span> A favor is to be met with another favor; it is not to be met with neglect, and certainly not with attack. But within the similar-action boundaries, considerable flexibility is allowed. A small initial favor can produce a sense of obligation to agree to a substantially larger return favor. Since, as we have already seen, the rule allows one person to choose the nature of the indebting first favor and the nature of the debt-canceling return favor, we could easily be manipulated into an unfair exchange by those who might wish to exploit the rule.</div></li><li><div>Why should it be that small first favors often stimulate larger return favors? One important reason concerns the clearly unpleasant character of the feeling of indebtedness. Most of us find it highly disagreeable to be in a state of obligation. It weighs heavily on us and demands to be removed.</div></li><li><div>A person who violates the reciprocity rule by accepting without attempting to return the good acts of others is actively disliked by the social group. The exception, of course, is when the person is prevented from repayment by reasons of circumstance or ability. For the most part, however, there is a genuine distaste for individuals who fail to conform to the dictates of the reciprocity rule.</div></li><ul><li><div>A cross-cultural study has shown that those who break the reciprocity rule in the reverse direction—by giving without allowing the recipient an opportunity to repay—are also disliked for it. This result was found to hold for each of the three nationalities investigated—Americans, Swedes, and Japanese.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">In combination, the reality of internal discomfort and the possibility of external shame can produce a heavy psychological cost.</span></div></li><li><div>People will often avoid asking for a needed favor if they will not be in a position to repay it. The psychological cost may simply outweigh the material loss.</div></li><li><div>If, instead of paying for them herself, a woman allows a man to buy her drinks, she is immediately judged (by both men and women) as more sexually available to him.</div></li></ul><li><div>RECIPROCAL CONCESSIONS</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The general rule says that a person who acts in a certain way toward us is entitled to a similar return action.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Another consequence of the rule, however, is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.</span></div></li><li><div>The reciprocation rule brings about mutual concession in two ways. The first is obvious. It pressures the recipient of an already-made concession to respond in kind. The second, while not so obvious, is pivotally important. Just as in the case of favors, gifts, or aid, the obligation to reciprocate a concession encourages the creation of socially desirable arrangements by ensuring that anyone seeking to start such an arrangement will not be exploited.</div></li><li><div>Because the rule for reciprocation governs the compromise process, it is possible to use an initial concession as part of a highly effective compliance technique. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The technique is a simple one that we can call the rejection-then-retreat technique. Suppose you want me to agree to a certain request. One way to increase your chances would be first to make a larger request of me, one that I will most likely turn down. Then, after I have refused, you would make the smaller request that you were really interested in all along.</span> Provided that you have structured your requests skillfully, I should view your second request as a concession to me and should feel inclined to respond with a concession of my own, the only one I would have immediately open to me—compliance with your second request.</div></li><li><div>Research conducted at Bar-Ilan University in Israel on the rejection-then-retreat technique shows that if the first set of demands is so extreme as to be seen as unreasonable, the tactic backfires. In such cases, the party who has made the extreme first request is not seen to be bargaining in good faith. Any subsequent retreat from that wholly unrealistic initial position is not viewed as a genuine concession and thus is not reciprocated.</div></li><li><div>On the Happy Days series, the biggest censorship fight was over the word “virgin.” That time, says Marshall, “I knew we’d have trouble, so we put the word in seven times, hoping they’d cut six and keep one. It worked.</div></li><li><div>I witnessed another form of the rejection-then-retreat technique in my investigations of door-to-door sales operations. These organizations used a less engineered, more opportunistic version of the tactic. Of course, the most important goal for a door-to-door salesperson is to make the sale. However, the training programs of each of the companies I investigated emphasized that a second important goal was to obtain from prospects the names of referrals—friends, relatives, or neighbors on whom we could call.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The percentage of successful door-to-door sales increases impressively when the sales operator is able to mention the name of a familiar person who “recommended” the sales visit.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The larger-then-smaller-request procedure makes use of the contrast principle by making the smaller request look even smaller by comparison with the larger one.</span> If I want you to lend me five dollars, I can make it seem like a smaller request by first asking you to lend me ten dollars. One of the beauties of this tactic is that by first requesting ten dollars and then retreating to five dollars, I will have simultaneously engaged the force of the reciprocity rule and the contrast principle.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The rejection-then-retreat procedure was more than four times more effective than the procedure of asking for the smaller request only.</span></div></li><li><div>Let’s once again say that I wish to borrow five dollars from you. By beginning with a ten-dollar request, I really can’t lose. If you agree to it, I will have gotten twice the amount from you I would have settled for. If, on the other hand, you turn down my initial request, I can retreat to the five-dollar favor that I desired from the outset and, through the action of the reciprocity and contrast principles, greatly enhance my likelihood of success.</div></li><li><div>The procedure of starting with a larger request (to volunteer for two hours of work per week in the agency for at least two years) produced more verbal agreement to the smaller retreat request (76 percent) than did the procedure of asking for the smaller request alone (29 percent). The important result, though, concerned the show-up rate of those who volunteered; and, again, the rejection-then-retreat procedure was the more effective one (85 percent vs. 50 percent).</div></li><li><div>One group of targets was first asked to give a pint of blood every six weeks for a minimum of three years. The other targets were asked only to give the single pint of blood. Those of both groups who agreed to give a pint of blood and who later appeared at the blood center were then asked if they would be willing to give their phone numbers so they could be called upon to donate again in the future. Nearly all the students who were about to give a pint of blood as a result of the rejection-then-retreat technique agreed to donate again later (84 percent), while less than half of the other students who appeared at the blood center did so (43 percent).</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Responsibility. Those subjects facing the opponent who used the retreating strategy felt most responsible for the final deal.</span></div></li><li><div>The requester’s concession within the technique not only causes targets to say yes more often, it also causes them to feel more responsible for having “dictated” the final agreement.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Satisfaction. Since the tactic uses a concession to bring about compliance, the victim is likely to feel more satisfied with the arrangement as a result. And it stands to reason that people who are satisfied with a given arrangement are more likely to be willing to agree to further such arrangements.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>HOW TO SAY NO</div></li><ul><li><div>As long as we perceive and define his action as a compliance device instead of a favor, he no longer has the reciprocation rule as an ally: <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The rule says that favors are to be met with favors; it does not require that tricks be met with favors.</span></div></li><li><div>Reciprocity rule asserts that if justice is to be done, exploitation attempts should be exploited.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>Chapter 3: COMMITMENT AND CONSISTENCY</div></li><ul><li><div>It is easier to resist at the beginning than at the end. —LEONARDO DA VINCI</div></li><li><div>About people at the racetrack: Just after placing a bet, they are much more confident of their horse’s chances of winning than they are immediately before laying down that bet.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment. </span>Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify our earlier decision.</div></li><li><div>Inconsistency is commonly thought to be an undesirable personality trait. The person whose beliefs, words, and deeds don’t match may be seen as indecisive, confused, two-faced, or even mentally ill. On the other side, a high degree of consistency is normally associated with personal and intellectual strength. It is at the heart of logic, rationality, stability, and honesty.</div></li><li><div>When it occurs unthinkingly, consistency can be disastrous. Nonetheless, even blind consistency has its attractions. It allows us a convenient, relatively effortless, and efficient method for dealing with complex daily environments that make severe demands on our mental energies and capacities.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Automatic consistency functions as a shield against thought.</span></div></li><li><div>COMMITMENT IS THE KEY</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">If I can get you to make a commitment (that is, to take a stand, to go on record), I will have set the stage for your automatic and ill-considered consistency with that earlier commitment. Once a stand is taken, there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are stubbornly consistent with the stand.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">People who have just asserted that they are doing/feeling fine—even as a routine part of a sociable exchange—will consequently find it awkward to appear stingy in the context of their own admittedly favored circumstances.</span></div></li><li><div>Callers began either with the question “How are you feeling this evening?” (and waited for a response before proceeding) or with the statement “I hope you are feeling well this evening” and then proceeded to the standard solicitation approach. Despite the fact that the caller started each type of interaction with a warm and friendly comment, the <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“How are you feeling” technique was, by far, superior to its rival (33 percent vs. 15 percent compliance), because it alone drew an exploitable public commitment from its targets.</span></div></li><li><div>For the salesperson, the strategy is to obtain a large purchase by starting with a small one. Almost any small sale will do, because the purpose of that small transaction is not profit. It is commitment.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The tactic of starting with a little request in order to gain eventual compliance with related larger requests has a name: the foot-in-the-door technique.</span></div></li><li><div>What may occur is a change in the person’s feelings about getting involved or taking action. Once he has agreed to a request, his attitude may change, he may become, in his own eyes, the kind of person who does this sort of thing, who agrees to requests made by strangers, who takes action on things he believes in, who cooperates with good causes.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Be very careful about agreeing to trivial requests. Such an agreement can not only increase our compliance with very similar, much larger requests, it can also make us more willing to perform a variety of larger favors that are only remotely connected to the little one we did earlier.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Once a person’s self-image is altered, all sorts of subtle advantages become available to someone who wants to exploit that new image.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">You can use small commitments to manipulate a person’s self-image;</span></div></li><li><div>The Magic Act</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Our best evidence of what people truly feel and believe comes less from their words than from their deeds. Observers trying to decide what a man is like look closely at his actions.</span></div></li><li><div>Man himself uses this same evidence to decide what he is like. His behavior tells him about himself; it is a primary source of information about his beliefs and values and attitudes.</div></li><li><div>As a commitment device, a written declaration has some great advantages. First, it provides physical evidence that the act occurred.</div></li><li><div>There it was in his own handwriting, an irrevocably documented act driving him to make his beliefs and his self-image consistent with what he had undeniably done.</div></li><li><div>A second advantage of a written testament is that it can be shown to other people. Of course, that means it can be used to persuade those people. It can persuade them to change their own attitudes in the direction of the statement. But more important for the purpose of commitment, it can persuade them that the author genuinely believes what was written. People have a natural tendency to think that a statement reflects the true attitude of the person who made it. What is surprising is that they continue to think so even when they know that the person did not freely choose to make the statement.</div></li><li><div>Unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, observers automatically assume that someone who makes such a statement means it.</div></li><li><div>Once an active commitment is made, then, self-image is squeezed from both sides by consistency pressures. From the inside, there is a pressure to bring self-image into line with action. From the outside, there is a sneakier pressure—a tendency to adjust this image according to the way others perceive us. And because others see us as believing what we have written (even when we’ve had little choice in the matter), we will once again experience a pull to bring self-image into line with the written statement.</div></li><li><div>Participants voluntarily write essays for attractive prizes that they have only a small chance to win. But they know that for an essay to have any chance of winning at all, it must include praise for the product. So they find praiseworthy features of the product and describe them in their essays. The result is hundreds of men in Korea or hundreds of thousands of people in America who testify in writing to the product’s appeal and who, consequently, experience that “magical” pull to believe what they have written.</div></li></ul><li><div>The Public Eye</div></li><ul><li><div>One reason that written testaments are effective in bringing about genuine personal change is that they can so easily be made public. The prisoner experience in Korea showed the Chinese to be quite aware of an important psychological principle: <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Public commitments tend to be lasting commitments.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Whenever one takes a stand that is visible to others, there arises a drive to maintain that stand in order to look like a consistent person.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">For appearances’ sake, then, the more public a stand, the more reluctant we will be to change it.</span></div></li><li><div>The students who had never written down their first choices were the least loyal to those choices. When new evidence was presented that questioned the wisdom of decisions that had never left their heads, these students were the most influenced by the new information to change what they had viewed as the “correct” decision. Compared to these uncommitted students, those who had merely written their decisions for a moment on a Magic Pad were significantly less willing to change their minds when given the chance. Even though they had committed themselves under the most anonymous of circumstances, the act of writing down their first judgments caused them to resist the influence of contradictory new data and to remain consistent with the preliminary choices. But Deutsch and Gerard found that, by far, it was the students who had publicly recorded their initial positions who most resolutely refused to shift from those positions later. Public commitment had hardened them into the most stubborn of all.</div></li></ul><li><div>The Effort Extra</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Yet another reason that written commitments are so effective is that they require more work than verbal ones. And the evidence is clear that the more effort that goes into a commitment, the greater is its ability to influence the attitudes of the person who made it.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort.</span></div></li><li><div>The more electric shock a woman received as part of the initiation ceremony, the more she later persuaded herself that her new group and its activities were interesting, intelligent, and desirable.</div></li><li><div>The loyalty and dedication of those who emerge will increase to a great degree the chances of group cohesiveness and survival. Indeed, one study of fifty-four tribal cultures found that those with the most dramatic and stringent initiation ceremonies were those with the greatest group solidarity.</div></li></ul><li><div>The Inner Choice</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Commitments are most effective in changing a person’s self-image and future behavior when they are active, public, and effortful.</span></div></li><li><div>Although the settings are quite different, the surveyed fraternities refused to allow civic activities into their initiation ceremonies for the same reason that the Chinese withheld large prizes in favor of less powerful inducements: They wanted the men to own what they had done. No excuses, no ways out were allowed. A man who suffered through an arduous hazing could not be given the chance to believe he did so for charitable purposes. A prisoner who salted his political essay with a few anti-American comments could not be permitted to shrug it off as motivated by a big reward. No, the fraternity chapters and Chinese Communists were playing for keeps. It was not enough to wring commitments out of their men; those men had to be made to take inner responsibility for their actions.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Social scientists have determined that we accept inner responsibility for a behavior when we think we have chosen to perform it in the absence of strong outside pressures. </span>A large reward is one such external pressure. It may get us to perform a certain action, but it won’t get us to accept inner responsibility for the act. Consequently, we won’t feel committed to it. The same is true of a strong threat; it may motivate immediate compliance, but it is unlikely to produce long-term commitment.</div></li><li><div>The important thing is to use a reason that will initially produce the desired behavior and will, at the same time, allow a child to take personal responsibility for that behavior. Thus, the less detectable outside pressure such a reason contains, the better. Selecting just the right reason is not an easy task for parents. But the effort should pay off. It is likely to mean the difference between short-lived compliance and long-term commitment.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Compliance professionals love commitments that produce inner change. First, that change is not just specific to the situation where it first occurred; it covers a whole range of related situations, too. Second, the effects of the change are lasting.</span> So, once a man has been induced to take action that shifts his self-image to that of, let’s say, a public-spirited citizen, he is likely to be public-spirited in a variety of other circumstances where his compliance may also be desired, and he is likely to continue his public-spirited behavior for as long as his new self-image holds.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">There is yet another attraction in commitments that lead to inner change—they grow their own legs. There is no need for the compliance professional to undertake a costly and continuing effort to reinforce the change; the pressure for consistency will take care of all that.</span></div></li><li><div>In general, because of the need to be consistent within his system of beliefs, he will assure himself that his choice to take public-spirited action was right. What is important about this process of generating additional reasons to justify the commitment is that the reasons are new. Thus, even if the original reason for the civic-minded behavior was taken away, these newly discovered reasons might be enough by themselves to support his perception that he had behaved correctly.</div></li><li><div>No matter which variety of <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">lowballing</span> is used, the sequence is the same: <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">An advantage is offered that induces a favorable purchase decision; then, sometime after the decision has been made but before the bargain is sealed, the original purchase advantage is deftly removed.</span></div></li><li><div>The impressive thing about the lowball tactic is its ability to make a person feel pleased with a poor choice. Those who have only poor choices to offer us, then, are especially fond of the technique.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>HOW TO SAY NO</div></li><ul><li><div>Since automatic consistency is so useful in allowing us an economical and appropriate way of behaving most of the time, we can’t decide merely to eliminate it from our lives altogether.</div></li><li><div>Know when such consistency is likely to lead to a poor choice. There are certain signals—two separate kinds of signals, in fact—to tip us off.</div></li><li><div>The first sort of signal is easy to recognize. It occurs right in the pit of our stomachs when we realize we are trapped into complying with a request we know we don’t want to perform.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“Knowing what I now know, if I could go back in time, would I make the same choice?”</span></div></li><li><div>Accumulating psychological evidence indicates that we experience our feelings toward something a split second before we can intellectualize about it. My suspicion is that the message sent by the heart of hearts is a pure, basic feeling. Therefore, if we train ourselves to be attentive, we should register it ever so slightly before our cognitive apparatus engages.</div></li><li><div>By extracting a kiss, the salesman exploited the consistency principle in two ways. First, by the time he asked for her aid in the magazine contest, his prospect had already gone on record—with that kiss—as agreeing to help him win a contest. Second, it seems only natural (i.e., congruent) that if a woman feels positively enough toward a man to kiss him, she should feel positively toward helping him out.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>Chapter 4: SOCIAL PROOF</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Where all think alike, no one thinks very much. —WALTER LIPPMANN</span></div></li><li><div>Experiments have found that the use of canned merriment causes an audience to laugh longer and more often when humorous material is presented and to rate the material as funnier. In addition, some evidence indicates that canned laughter is most effective for poor jokes.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The principle of social proof. It states that one means we use to determine what is correct is to find out what other people think is correct.</span> The principle applies especially to the way we decide what constitutes correct behavior. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">We view a behavior as more correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it.</span></div></li><li><div>As a rule, we will make fewer mistakes by acting in accord with social evidence than contrary to it. Usually, when a lot of people are doing something, it is the right thing to do. This feature of the principle of social proof is simultaneously its major strength and its major weakness. Like the other weapons of influence, it provides a convenient shortcut for determining how to behave but, at the same time, makes one who uses the shortcut vulnerable to the attacks of profiteers who lie in wait along its path.</div></li><li><div>Our tendency to assume that an action is more correct if others are doing it is exploited in a variety of settings. Bartenders often “salt” their tip jars with a few dollar bills at the beginning of the evening to simulate tips left by prior customers and thereby to give the impression that tipping with folding money is proper barroom behavior.</div></li><li><div>Sales and motivation consultant Cavett Robert captures the principle nicely in his advice to sales trainees: “Since 95 percent of the people are imitators and only 5 percent initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any proof we can offer.”</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The principle of social proof says so: The greater the number of people who find any idea correct, the more the idea will be correct.</span></div></li><li><div>CAUSE OF DEATH: UNCERTAIN(TY)</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">In general, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct.</span></div></li><li><div>Especially in an ambiguous situation, the tendency for everyone to be looking to see what everyone else is doing can lead to a fascinating phenomenon called “<span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">pluralistic ignorance</span>.” A thorough understanding of the pluralistic ignorance phenomenon helps immeasurably to explain a regular occurrence in our country that has been termed both a riddle and a national disgrace: <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">the failure of entire groups of bystanders to aid victims in agonizing need of help.</span></div></li><li><div>The psychologists speculated that, for at least two reasons, a bystander to an emergency would be unlikely to help when there were a number of other bystanders present. The first reason is fairly straightforward. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">With several potential helpers around, the personal responsibility of each individual is reduced: “Perhaps someone else will give or call for aid, perhaps someone else already has.”</span> So with everyone thinking that someone else will help or has helped, no one does.</div></li><li><div>The second reason is the more psychologically intriguing one; it is founded on the principle of social proof and involves the pluralistic ignorance effect.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">In times of such uncertainty, the natural tendency is to look around at the actions of others for clues. We can learn, from the way the other witnesses are reacting, whether the event is or is not an emergency.</span></div></li><li><div>What is easy to forget, though, is that everybody else observing the event is likely to be looking for social evidence, too. And because we all prefer to appear poised and unflustered among others, we are likely to search for that evidence placidly, with brief, camouflaged glances at those around us. Therefore everyone is likely to see everyone else looking unruffled and failing to act. As a result, and by the principle of social proof, the event will be roundly interpreted as a nonemergency.</div></li><li><div>The fascinating upshot of Latané and Darley’s reasoning is that, for the emergency victim, the idea of “safety in numbers” may often be completely wrong. It might be that someone in need of emergency aid would have a better chance of survival if a single bystander, rather than a crowd, was present.</div></li><li><div>Once witnesses are convinced that an emergency situation exists, aid is very likely.</div></li><li><div>As in many cases, bystanders cannot be sure that the event they are witnessing is an emergency. Then a victim is much more likely to be helped by a lone bystander than by a group, especially if the people in the group are strangers to one another. It seems that the pluralistic ignorance effect is strongest among strangers: Because we like to look poised and sophisticated in public and because we are unfamiliar with the reactions of those we do not know, we are unlikely to give off or correctly read expressions of concern when in a grouping of strangers. Therefore, a possible emergency becomes viewed as a nonemergency, and the victim suffers.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">All the conditions that decrease an emergency victim’s chances for bystander aid exist normally and innocently in the city</span>:</div></li><ul><li><div>In contrast to rural areas, cities are more clamorous, distracting, rapidly changing places where it is difficult to be certain of the nature of the events one encounters.</div></li><li><div>Urban environments are more populous, by their nature; consequently, people are more likely to be with others when witnessing a potential emergency situation.</div></li><li><div>City dwellers know a much smaller percentage of fellow residents than do people who live in small towns; therefore, city dwellers are more likely to find themselves in a group of strangers when observing an emergency.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">These three natural characteristics of urban environments—their confusion, their populousness, and their low levels of acquaintanceship—fit in very well with the factors shown by research to decrease bystander aid.</span></div></li><li><div>Devictimizing Yourself</div></li><ul><li><div>In general, then, your best strategy when in need of emergency help is to reduce the uncertainties of those around you concerning your condition and their responsibilities. Be as precise as possible about your need for aid. Do not allow bystanders to come to their own conclusions because, especially in a crowd, the principle of social proof and the consequent pluralistic ignorance effect might well cause them to view your situation as a nonemergency.</div></li><li><div>And request assistance of a single individual from the group of onlookers. Fight the natural tendency to make a general request for help. Pick out one person and assign the task to that individual.

It is the conduct of such people that gives us the greatest insight into what constitutes correct behavior for ourselves. Therefore we are more inclined to follow the lead of a similar individual than a dissimilar one.</span></div></li><li><div>Newspaper stories reporting on suicide victims who died alone produce an increase in the frequency of single-fatality wrecks only, whereas stories reporting on suicide-plus-murder incidents produce an increase in multiple-fatality wrecks only.</div></li><li><div>“Werther effect": Certain troubled people who read of another’s self-inflicted death kill themselves in imitation. In a morbid illustration of the principle of social proof, these people decide how they should act on the basis of how some other troubled person has acted.</div></li><li><div>Within two months after every front-page suicide story, an average of fifty-eight more people than usual killed themselves. In a sense, each suicide story killed fifty-eight people who otherwise would have gone on living. Phillips also found that this tendency for suicides to beget suicides occurred principally in those parts of the country where the first suicide was highly publicized and that the wider the publicity given the first suicide, the greater the number of later suicides.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The most influential leaders are those who know how to arrange group conditions to allow the principle of social proof to work maximally in their favor.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>HOW TO SAY NO</div></li><ul><li><div>There are two types of situation in which incorrect data cause the principle of social proof to give us poor counsel. The first occurs when the social evidence has been purposely falsified.</div></li><li><div>Because automatic pilots can be engaged and disengaged at will, we can cruise along trusting in the course steered by the principle of social proof until we recognize that a piece of inaccurate data is being used. Then we can take the controls, make the necessary correction for the misinformation, and reset the automatic pilot.</div></li><li><div>The way we respond to social proof. First, we seem to assume that if a lot of people are doing the same thing, they must know something we don’t. Especially when we are uncertain, we are willing to place an enormous amount of trust in the collective knowledge of the crowd. Second, quite frequently the crowd is mistaken because they are not acting on the basis of any superior information but are reacting, themselves, to the principle of social proof.</div></li><li><div>An automatic-pilot device, like social proof, should never be trusted fully; even when no saboteur has fed bad information into the mechanism, it can sometimes go haywire by itself. We need to check the machine from time to time to be sure that it hasn’t worked itself out of sync with the other sources of evidence in the situation—the objective facts, our prior experiences, our own judgments.</div></li><li><div>The consequences of single-minded reliance on social evidence can be frightening.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Once again we can see that social proof is most powerful for those who feel unfamiliar or unsure in a specific situation and who, consequently, must look outside of themselves for evidence of how best to behave there.</span></div></li></ul></ul><li><div>Chapter 5: LIKING</div></li><ul><li><div>The main work of a trial attorney is to make a jury like his client. —CLARENCE DARROW</div></li><li><div>What are the factors that cause one person to like another person?</div></li><li><div>Physical Attractiveness</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">A halo effect occurs when one positive characteristic of a person dominates the way that person is viewed by others.</span> And the evidence is now clear that physical attractiveness is often such a characteristic.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Research has shown that we automatically assign to good-looking individuals such favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“Good-looking equals good”</span></div></li><li><div>A study of the Canadian federal elections found that attractive candidates received more than two and a half times as many votes as unattractive candidates.</div></li><li><div>In one study, good grooming of applicants in a simulated employment interview accounted for more favorable hiring decisions than did job qualifications—this, even though the interviewers claimed that appearance played a small role in their choices.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Good-looking people enjoy an enormous social advantage in our culture.

This fact seems to hold true whether the similarity is in the area of opinions, personality traits, background, or life-style.</span></div></li><li><div>Several studies have demonstrated that we are more likely to help those who dress like us.</div></li><li><div>Another way requesters can manipulate similarity to increase liking and compliance is to claim that they have backgrounds and interests similar to ours.</div></li><li><div>Customers were more likely to buy insurance when the salesperson was like them in such areas as age, religion, politics, and cigarette-smoking habits. Because even small similarities can be effective in producing a positive response to another and because a veneer of similarity can be so easily manufactured,</div></li></ul><li><div>Compliments</div></li><ul><li><div>We are phenomenal suckers for flattery. Although there are limits to our gullibility—especially when we can be sure that the flatterer is trying to manipulate us—<span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">we tend, as a rule, to believe praise and to like those who provide it, oftentimes when it is clearly false.</span></div></li><li><div>The men in the study received comments about themselves from another person who needed a favor from them. Some of the men got only positive comments, some got only negative comments, and some got a mixture of good and bad. There were three interesting findings. First, the evaluator who provided only praise was liked best by the men. Second, this was the case even though the men fully realized that the flatterer stood to gain from their liking him. Finally, unlike the other types of comments, pure praise did not have to be accurate to work. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Positive comments produced just as much liking for the flatterer when they were untrue as when they were true.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Contact and Cooperation</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Familiarity affects liking.

In fact, continued exposure to a person or object under unpleasant conditions such as frustration, conflict, or competition leads to less liking.</span></div></li><li><div>Simply separating the boys into two residence cabins was enough to stimulate a “we vs. they” feeling between the groups; and assigning names to the two groups (the Eagles and the Rattlers) accelerated the sense of rivalry.

Then mix together over the flame of continued competition.</div></li><li><div>The consequences, though not instantaneous, were nonetheless striking. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Conjoint efforts toward common goals steadily bridged the rancorous rift between the groups.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Conditioning and Association</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">There is a natural human tendency to dislike a person who brings us unpleasant information, even when that person did not cause the bad news.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The principle of association is a general one, governing both negative and positive connections.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Using what he termed the “luncheon technique,” he found that his subjects became fonder of the people and things they experienced while they were eating.</span></div></li><li><div>Razran’s insight was that there are many normal responses to food besides salivation, one of them being a good and favorable feeling. Therefore, it is possible to attach this pleasant feeling, this positive attitude, to anything (political statements being only an example) that is closely associated with good food.</div></li><li><div>As distinguished author Isaac Asimov put it in describing our reactions to the contests we view, <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“All things being equal, you root for your own sex, your own culture, your own locality…and what you want to prove is that you are better than the other person. Whomever you root for represents you; and when he wins, you win.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">According to the association principle, if we can surround ourselves with success that we are connected with in even a superficial way (for example, place of residence), our public prestige will rise.</span></div></li><li><div>In one experiment showing how wearing apparel can serve to proclaim such an association, researchers counted the number of school sweatshirts worn on Monday mornings by students on the campuses of seven prominent football universities: Arizona State, Louisiana State, Notre Dame, Michigan, Ohio State, Pittsburgh, and Southern California. The results showed that many more home-school shirts were worn if the football team had won its game on the prior Saturday. What’s more, the larger the margin of victory, the more such shirts appeared. It wasn’t a close, hard-fought game that caused the students to dress themselves, literally, in success; instead, it was a clear, crushing conquest smacking of indisputable superiority.</div></li><li><div>All this tells me that we purposefully manipulate the visibility of our connections with winners and losers in order to make ourselves look good to anyone who could view these connections. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">By showcasing the positive associations and burying the negative ones, we are trying to get observers to think more highly of us and to like us more.</span></div></li><li><div>When ever our public image is damaged, we will experience an increased desire to restore that image by trumpeting our ties to successful others. At the same time, we will most scrupulously avoid publicizing our ties to failing others.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">It is not when we have a strong feeling of recognized personal accomplishment that we will seek to bask in reflected glory. Instead, it will be when prestige (both public and private) is low that we will be intent upon using the successes of associated others to help restore image.</span></div></li><li><div>Deep inside is a sense of low personal worth that directs them to seek prestige not from the generation or promotion of their own attainments, but from the generation or promotion of their associations with others of attainment.</div></li></ul><li><div>HOW TO SAY NO</div></li><ul><li><div>By concentrating our attention on the effect rather than the causes, we can avoid the laborious, nearly impossible task of trying to detect and deflect the many psychological influences on liking. Instead, we have to be sensitive to only one thing related to liking in our contacts with compliance practitioners: the feeling that we have come to like the practitioner more quickly or more deeply than we would have expected.</div></li><li><div>The recognition of that feeling can serve as our reminder to separate the dealer from the merits of the deal and to make our decision based on considerations related only to the latter.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>Chapter 6: AUTHORITY</div></li><ul><li><div>Follow an expert. —VIRGIL</div></li><li><div>“It is the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority that constitutes the chief finding of the study.”</div></li><li><div>In the case of obedience to authority, even a brief consideration of human social organization offers justification aplenty. A multilayered and widely accepted system of authority confers an immense advantage upon a society.</div></li><li><div>We are trained from birth that obedience to proper authority is right and disobedience is wrong.</div></li><li><div>The very first book of the Bible, for example, describes how failure to obey the ultimate authority produced the loss of paradise for Adam, Eve, and the rest of the human race.</div></li><li><div>We rarely agonize to such a degree over the pros and cons of authority’s demands. In fact, our obedience frequently takes place in a click, whirr fashion, with little or no conscious deliberation.<span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;"> Information from a recognized authority can provide us a valuable shortcut for deciding how to act in a situation.</span></div></li><li><div>Authority figures now appear as employers, judges, and government leaders. Because their positions speak of superior access to information and power, it makes great sense to comply with the wishes of properly constituted authorities. It makes so much sense, in fact, that we often do so when it makes no sense at all.</div></li><li><div>CONNOTATION, NOT CONTENT</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">We are often as vulnerable to the symbols of authority as to the substance.</span></div></li><li><div>There are several kinds of symbols that can reliably trigger our compliance in the absence of the genuine substance of authority. Consequently, they are employed extensively by those compliance professionals who are short on substance.</div></li><li><div>Titles</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Titles are simultaneously the most difficult and the easiest symbols of authority to acquire.</span> To earn one normally takes years of work and achievement. Yet it is possible for somebody who has put in none of this effort to adopt the mere label and receive a kind of automatic deference.</div></li><li><div>Studies investigating the way in which authority status affects perceptions of size have found that prestigious titles lead to height distortions.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">it is not necessarily the pleasantness of a thing that makes it seem bigger to us, it is its importance.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Clothes</div></li><ul><li><div>Regardless of the type of request, many more people obeyed the requester when he wore the guard costume.</div></li></ul><li><div>Trappings</div></li><ul><li><div>According to the findings of a study done in the San Francisco Bay area, owners of prestige autos receive a special kind of deference from us. The experimenters discovered that motorists would wait significantly longer before honking their horns at a new, luxury car stopped in front of a green traffic light than at an older, economy model.</div></li></ul><li><div>As in Milgram’s research, the midwestern hospital-nurses’ study, and the security-guard-uniform experiment, people were unable to predict correctly how they or others would react to authority influence. In each instance, the effect of such influence was grossly underestimated. This property of authority status may account for much of its success as a compliance device. Not only does it work forcefully on us, but it also does so unexpectedly.</div></li></ul><li><div>HOW TO SAY NO</div></li><ul><li><div>Ask, when we are confronted with what appears to be an authority figure’s influence attempt,</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“Is this authority truly an expert?”</span></div></li><ul><li><div>The question is helpful because it focuses our attention on a pair of crucial pieces of information: the authority’s credentials and the relevance of those credentials to the topic at hand. By orienting in this simple way toward the evidence for authority status, we can avoid the major pitfalls of automatic deference.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“How truthful can we expect the expert to be here?”</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Authorities, even the best informed, may not present their information honestly to us. Therefore we need to consider their trustworthiness in the situation.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>By wondering how an expert stands to benefit from our compliance, we give ourselves another safety net against undue and automatic influence. Even knowledgeable authorities in a field will not persuade us until we are satisfied that their messages represent the facts faithfully.</div></li><li><div>When asking ourselves about such a person’s trustworthiness, we should keep in mind a little tactic compliance practitioners often use to assure us of their sincerity: They will seem to argue to a degree against their own interests.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>Chapter 7: SCARCITY</div></li><ul><li><div>The way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost. —G. K. CHESTERTON</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The scarcity principle—that opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availability is limited.</span></div></li><li><div>The idea of potential loss plays a large role in human decision making. In fact, people seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">As a rule, if it is rare or becoming rare, it is more valuable.</span></div></li><li><div>The most straightforward use of the scarcity principle occurs in the “limited-number” tactic, when the customer is informed that a certain product is in short supply that cannot be guaranteed to last long.</div></li><li><div>“Well,” the salesperson allows, “that is possible, and I’d be willing to check. But do I understand that this is the model you want and if I can get it for you at this price, you’ll take it?” Therein lies the beauty of the technique. In accord with the scarcity principle, the customers are asked to commit to buying the appliance when it looks least available—and therefore most desirable. Many customers do agree to a purchase at this singularly vulnerable time.</div></li><li><div>PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTANCE</div></li><ul><li><div>Like the other weapons of influence, the scarcity principle trades on our weakness for shortcuts. The weakness is, as before, an enlightened one. In this case, <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">because we know that the things that are difficult to possess are typically better than those that are easy to possess, we can often use an item’s availability to help us quickly and correctly decide on its quality.</span> Thus, one reason for the potency of the scarcity principle is that, by following it, we are usually and efficiently right.</div></li><li><div>In addition, there is a unique, secondary source of power within the scarcity principle: <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">As opportunities become less available, we lose freedoms; and we hate to lose the freedoms we already have.</span> This desire to preserve our established prerogatives is the centerpiece of psychological reactance theory, developed by psychologist Jack Brehm to explain the human response to diminishing personal control. According to the theory, whenever free choice is limited or threatened, the need to retain our freedoms makes us desire them (as well as the goods and services associated with them) significantly more than previously. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">So when increasing scarcity—or anything else—interferes with our prior access to some item, we will react against the interference by wanting and trying to possess the item more than before.</span></div></li><li><div>When our freedom to have something is limited, the item becomes less available, and we experience an increased desire for it. However, we rarely recognize that psychological reactance has caused us to want the item more; all we know is that we want it. Still, we need to make sense of our desire for the item, so we begin to assign it positive qualities to justify the desire.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Almost invariably, our response to the banning of information is a greater desire to receive that information and a more favorable attitude toward it than before the ban.</span></div></li><li><div>The students were shown some advertisements for a novel. For half the students, the advertising copy included the statement, “a book for adults only, restricted to those 21 years and over”; the other half of the students read about no such age restriction on the book. When the researchers later asked the students to indicate their feelings toward the book, they discovered the same pair of reactions we have noted with other bans: Those who learned of the age restriction (1) wanted to read the book more and (2) believed that they would like the book more than did those who thought their access to the book was unlimited.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Information may not have to be censored for us to value it more; it need only be scarce. According to the scarcity principle, then, we will find a piece of information more persuasive if we think we can’t get it elsewhere.</span></div></li><li><div>Customers who heard of the impending scarcity via “exclusive” information. They purchased six times the amount that the customers who received only the standard sales pitch did. Apparently the fact that the news carrying the scarcity of information was itself scarce made it especially persuasive.</div></li></ul><li><div>OPTIMAL CONDITIONS</div></li><ul><li><div>Rather than rating the cookies under conditions of constant scarcity, some participants were first given a jar of ten cookies that was then replaced by a jar of two cookies. Thus, before taking a bite, certain of the participants saw their abundant supply of cookies reduced to a scarce supply. Other participants, however, knew only scarcity of supply from the outset, since the number of cookies in their jars was left at two. With this procedure, the researchers were seeking to answer a question about types of scarcity: Do we value more those things that have recently become less available to us, or those things that have always been scarce? In the cookie experiment, the answer was plain. The drop from abundance to scarcity produced a decidedly more positive reaction to the cookies than did constant scarcity.</div></li><li><div>Thus it is not the traditionally most downtrodden people—who have come to see their deprivation as part of the natural order of things—who are especially liable to revolt. Instead, revolutionaries are more likely to be those who have been given at least some taste of a better life. When the economic and social improvements they have experienced and come to expect suddenly become less available, they desire them more than ever and often rise up violently to secure them.118</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">A valuable lesson for would-be rulers: When it comes to freedoms, it is more dangerous to have given for a while than never to have given at all. </span>The problem for a government that seeks to improve the political and economic status of a traditionally oppressed group is that, in so doing, it establishes freedoms for the group where none existed before. And should these now established freedoms become less available, there will be an especially hot variety of hell to pay.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Freedoms once granted will not be relinquished without a fight.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Not only do we want the same item more when it is scarce, we want it most when we are in competition for it.</span></div></li><li><div>To attract and arouse the catch, fishermen scatter some loose bait called chum. For similar reasons, department stores holding a bargain sale toss out a few especially good deals on prominently advertised items called loss leaders. If the bait, of either form, has done its job, a large and eager crowd forms to snap it up. Soon, in the rush to score, the group becomes agitated, nearly blinded, by the adversarial nature of the situation. Humans and fish alike lose perspective on what they want and begin striking at whatever is being contested.</div></li></ul><li><div>HOW TO SAY NO</div></li><ul><li><div>Knowing the causes and workings of scarcity pressures may not be sufficient to protect us from them because knowing is a cognitive thing, and cognitive processes are suppressed by our emotional reaction to scarcity.</div></li><li><div>By learning to flag the experience of heightening arousal in a compliance situation, we can alert ourselves to the possibility of scarcity tactics there and to the need for caution.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The joy is not in experiencing a scarce commodity but in possessing it. It is important that we not confuse the two.</span></div></li><li><div>Whenever we confront the scarcity pressures surrounding some item, we must also confront the question of what it is we want from the item. Very often we don’t want a thing purely for the sake of owning it. We want it, instead, for its utility value; we want to eat it or drink it or touch it or hear it or drive it or otherwise use it. In such cases it is vital to remember that scarce things do not taste or feel or sound or ride or work any better because of their limited availability.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>Epilogue: INSTANT INFLUENCE</div></li><ul><li><div>Every day in every way, I’m getting better. —EMILE COUE</div></li><li><div>Every day in every way, I’m getting busier. —ROBERT CIALDINI</div></li><li><div>Very often in making a decision about someone or something, we don’t use all the relevant available information; we use, instead, only a single, highly representative piece of the total. And an isolated piece of information, even though it normally counsels us correctly, can lead us to clearly stupid mistakes—mistakes that, when exploited by clever others, leave us looking silly or worse.</div></li><li><div>Despite the susceptibility to stupid decisions that accompanies a reliance on a single feature of the available data, the pace of modern life demands that we frequently use this shortcut.</div></li><li><div>We employ the factors of reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity so often and so automatically in making our compliance decisions. Each, by itself, provides a highly reliable cue as to when we will be better off saying yes than no.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">We are likely to use these lone cues when we don’t have the inclination, time, energy, or cognitive resources to undertake a complete analysis of the situation.</span> Where we are rushed, stressed, uncertain, indifferent, distracted, or fatigued, we tend to focus on less of the information available to us. When making decisions under these circumstances, we often revert to the rather primitive but necessary single-piece-of-good-evidence approach.</div></li><li><div>Because technology can evolve much faster than we can, our natural capacity to process information is likely to be increasingly inadequate to handle the surfeit of change, choice, and challenge that is characteristic of modern life.</div></li><li><div>The blitz of modern daily life demands that we have faithful shortcuts, sound rules of thumb to handle it all. These are not luxuries any longer; they are out-and-out necessities that figure to become increasingly vital as the pulse of daily life quickens. That is why we should want to retaliate whenever we see someone betraying one of our rules of thumb for profit. We want that rule to be as effective as possible. But to the degree that its fitness for duty is regularly undercut by the tricks of a profiteer, we naturally will use it less and will be less able to cope efficiently with the decisional burdens of our day.</div></li></ul>

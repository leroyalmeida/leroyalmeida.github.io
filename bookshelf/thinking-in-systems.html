        <ul>
          <li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The Systems Lens</span><br></div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Managers are not confronted with problems that are independent of each other, but with dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that interact with each other. I call such situations messes. . . . Managers do not solve problems, they manage messes. —RUSSELL ACKOFF, operations theorist</div></li></ul><li><div><strong>What Is A System?</strong></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">A system is a set of things—people, cells, molecules, or whatever—interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time.</span></div></li><li><div>The system may be buffeted, constricted, triggered, or driven by outside forces. But the system’s response to these forces is characteristic of itself, and that response is seldom simple in the real world.</div></li><li><div>Because of feedback delays within complex systems, by the time a problem becomes apparent it may be unnecessarily difficult to solve.</div></li><li><div>According to the competitive exclusion principle, if a reinforcing feedback loop rewards the winner of a competition with the means to win further competitions, the result will be the elimination of all but a few competitors.</div></li><li><div>A diverse system with multiple pathways and redundancies is more stable and less vulnerable to external shock than a uniform system with little diversity.</div></li><li><div>Systems thinkers call these common structures that produce characteristic behaviors “archetypes.”</div></li><ul><li><div>These archetypes, which are responsible for some of the most intransigent and potentially dangerous problems, also can be transformed, with a little systems understanding, to produce much more desirable behaviors.</div></li></ul><li><div>The behavior of a system cannot be known just by knowing the elements of which the system is made.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The Basics</span></div></li><ul><li><div>I have yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when looked at in the right way, did not become still more complicated. —POUL ANDERSON</div></li><li><div>More Than the Sum of Its Parts</div></li><ul><li><div>A system isn’t just any old collection of things.</div></li><li><div>A system* is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something.</div></li><li><div>A system must consist of three kinds of things: elements, interconnections, and a function or purpose.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">A system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior.</span></div></li><li><div>There is an integrity or wholeness about a system and an active set of mechanisms to maintain that integrity.</div></li><li><div>Systems can change, adapt, respond to events, seek goals, mend injuries, and attend to their own survival in lifelike ways, although they may contain or consist of nonliving things.</div></li><li><div>Systems can be self-organizing, and often are self-repairing over at least some range of disruptions.</div></li></ul><li><div>Look Beyond the Players to the Rules of the Game</div></li><ul><li><div>You think that because you understand “one” that you must therefore understand “two” because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also understand “and.” —Sufi teaching story</div></li><li><div>The elements of a system are often the easiest parts to notice, because many of them are visible, tangible things.</div></li><li><div>Elements do not have to be physical things. Intangibles are also elements of a system.</div></li><li><div>How to know whether you are looking at a system or just a bunch of stuff:</div></li><ul><li><div>Can you identify parts?</div></li><li><div>Do the parts affect each other?</div></li><li><div>Do the parts together produce an effect that is different from the effect of each part on its own?</div></li><li><div>Does the effect, the behavior over time, persist in a variety of circumstances</div></li></ul><li><div>One you start listing the elements of a system, there is almost no end to it. Pretty soon, you lose sight of the system.</div></li><ul><li><div>You can’t see the forest for the trees</div></li><li><div>Start looking for Interconnections, the relationships that hold the elements together.</div></li></ul><li><div>It’s easier to learn about a system’s elements than about its interconnections.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information. Information holds systems together and plays a great role in determining how they operate.</span></div></li><li><div>Many interconnections are flows of information—signals that go to decision points or action points within a system.</div></li><li><div>Information about the existence of a problem may be necessary but not sufficient to trigger action—information about resources, incentives, and consequences is necessary too.)</div></li><li><div>A system’s function or purpose is not necessarily spoken, written, or expressed explicitly, except through the operation of the system. The best way to deduce the system’s purpose is to watch for a while to see how the system behaves.</div></li><li><div>Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals.</div></li><li><div>The word function is generally used for a nonhuman system, the word purpose for a human one, but the distinction is not absolute, since so many systems have both human and nonhuman elements.</div></li><li><div>An important function of almost every system is to ensure its own perpetuation.</div></li><li><div>System purposes need not be human purposes and are not necessarily those intended by any single actor within the system. In fact, one of the most frustrating aspects of systems is that the purposes of subunits may add up to an overall behavior that no one wants.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Systems can be nested within systems.

Feedbacks—the interconnections, the information part of the system—can fail for many reasons.</div></li><li><div>Information can arrive too late or at the wrong place.

It says that a flow can’t react instantly to a flow. It can react only to a change in a stock, and only after a slight delay to register the incoming information.</div></li><li><div>The specific principle you can deduce from this simple system is that you must remember in thermostat-like systems to take into account whatever draining or filling processes are going on.

Static stability is something you can see; it’s measured by variation in the condition of a system week by week or year by year. Resilience is something that may be very hard to see, unless you exceed its limits, overwhelm and damage the balancing loops, and the system structure breaks down.</div></li><li><div>Because resilience may not be obvious without a whole-system view, people often sacrifice resilience for stability, or for productivity, or for some other more immediately recognizable system property.</div></li><li><div>Large organizations of all kinds, from corporations to governments, lose their resilience simply because the feedback mechanisms by which they sense and respond to their environment have to travel through too many layers of delay and distortion.</div></li><li><div>Systems need to be managed not only for productivity or stability, they also need to be managed for resilience—the ability to recover from perturbation, the ability to restore or repair themselves.</div></li><li><div>Awareness of resilience enables one to see many ways to preserve or enhance a system’s own restorative powers.</div></li></ul><li><div>Self-Organization</div></li><ul><li><div>The most marvelous characteristic of some complex systems is their ability to learn, diversify, complexify, evolve.</div></li><ul><li><div>ability of a single fertilized ovum to generate, out of itself, the incredible complexity of a mature frog, or chicken, or person.</div></li><li><div>ability of a society to take the ideas of burning coal, making steam, pumping water, and specializing labor, and develop them eventually into an automobile assembly plant, a city of skyscrapers, a worldwide network of communications.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Capacity of a system to make its own structure more complex is called self-organization.</span></div></li><li><div>Like resilience, self-organization is often sacrificed for purposes of short-term productivity and stability.</div></li><li><div>Self-organization produces heterogeneity and unpredictability. It is likely come up with whole new structures, whole new ways of doing things. It requires freedom and experimentation, and a certain amount of disorder. These conditions that encourage self-organization often can be scary for individuals and threatening to power structures.</div></li><li><div>Systems often have the property of self-organization—the ability to structure themselves, to create new structure, to learn, diversify, and complexify. Even complex forms of self-organization may arise from relatively simple organizing rules—or may not.</div></li><li><div>In the process of creating new structures and increasing complexity, one thing that a self-organizing system often generates is hierarchy.</div></li></ul><li><div>Hierarchy</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">This arrangement of systems and subsystems is called a hierarchy.</span></div></li><li><div>Complex systems can evolve from simple systems only if there are stable intermediate forms. The resulting complex forms will naturally be hierarchic.</div></li><li><div>Hierarchies are brilliant systems inventions, not only because they give a system stability and resilience, but also because they reduce the amount of information that any part of the system has to keep track of.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">In hierarchical systems relationships within each subsystem are denser and stronger than relationships between subsystems.</span></div></li><li><div>If these differential information links within and between each level of the hierarchy are designed right, feedback delays are minimized. No level is overwhelmed with information.</div></li><li><div>If these differential information links within and between each level of the hierarchy are designed right, feedback delays are minimized. No level is overwhelmed with information. The system works with efficiency and resilience.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Hierarchical systems are partially decomposable. They can be taken apart and the subsystems with their especially dense information links can function, at least partially, as systems in their own right. </span>When hierarchies break down, they usually split along their subsystem boundaries.</div></li><li><div>Systems thinkers would say, the reductionist dissection of regular science teaches us a lot. However, one should not lose sight of the important relationships that each subsystem to the others and to the higher levels of the hierarchy,</div></li><li><div>If you have a liver disease, for example, a doctor usually can treat it without paying much attention to your heart or your tonsils (to stay on the same hierarchical level) or your personality (to move up a level or two) or the DNA in the nuclei of the liver cells (to move down several levels). There are just enough exceptions to that rule, however, to reinforce the necessity of stepping back to consider the whole hierarchy. Maybe your job exposes you to a chemical that is damaging your liver. Maybe the disease originates in a malfunction of the DNA.</div></li><li><div>What you need to think about may change over time, as self-organizing systems evolve new degrees of hierarchy and integration.</div></li><li><div>Hierarchies evolve from the lowest level up—from the pieces to the whole, from cell to organ to organism, from individual to team, from actual production to management of production.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The original purpose of a hierarchy is always to help its originating subsystems do their jobs better.</span></div></li><li><div>Many systems are not meeting our goals because of malfunctioning hierarchies.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">When a subsystem’s goals dominate at the expense of the total system’s goals, the resulting behavior is called suboptimization.</span></div></li><li><div>Just as damaging as suboptimization, of course, is the problem of too much central control.</div></li><li><div>To be a highly functional system, hierarchy must balance the welfare, freedoms, and responsibilities of the subsystems and total system—</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Hierarchical systems evolve from the bottom up. The purpose of the upper layers of the hierarchy is to serve the purposes of the lower layers.</span></div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Why Systems Surprise Us</span></div></li><ul><li><div>The trouble . . . is that we are terrifyingly ignorant. The most learned of us are ignorant. . . . The acquisition of knowledge always involves the revelation of ignorance—almost is the revelation of ignorance. Our knowledge of the world instructs us first of all that the world is greater than our knowledge of it. —Wendell Berry,1</div></li><li><div>Three truths:</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Everything we think we know about the world is a model.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Our models usually have a strong congruence with the world</span></div></li><ul><li><div>So are the ways I picture the world in my head—my mental models. None of these is or ever will be the real world.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">However, and conversely, our models fall far short of representing the world fully.</span> That is why we make mistakes and why we are regularly surprised.</div></li><ul><li><div>we can keep track of only a few variables at one time. We often draw illogical conclusions from accurate assumptions, or logical conclusions from inaccurate assumptions.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>Beguiling Events</div></li><ul><li><div>Systems fool us by presenting themselves—or we fool ourselves by seeing the world—as a series of events.</div></li><li><div>Events are the most visible aspect of a larger complex—but not always the most important.</div></li><li><div>We are less likely to be surprised if we can see how events accumulate into dynamic patterns of behavior.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The behavior of a system is its performance over time—its growth, stagnation, decline, oscillation, randomness, or evolution.</span></div></li><li><div>When a systems thinker encounters a problem, the first thing he or she does is look for data, time graphs, the history of the system.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Long term behavior provides clues to the underlying system structure.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Structure is the key to understanding not just what is happening, but why.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Structure determines what behaviors are latent in the system.</span></div></li><li><div>A goal-seeking balancing feedback loop approaches or holds a dynamic equilibrium. A reinforcing feedback loop generates exponential growth. The two of them linked together are capable of growth, decay, or equilibrium. If they also contain delays, they may produce oscillations. If they work in periodic, rapid bursts, they may produce even more surprising behaviors.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">System structure is the source of system behavior. System behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time.</span></div></li><li><div>Systems thinking goes back and forth constantly between structure (diagrams of stocks, flows, and feedback) and behavior (time graphs).</div></li><li><div>Systems thinkers strive to understand the connections between the hand releasing the Slinky (event) and the resulting oscillations (behavior) and the mechanical characteristics of the Slinky’s helical coil (structure).</div></li><li><div>Behavior-based models are more useful than event-based ones, but they still have fundamental problems.</div></li><ul><li><div>First, they typically overemphasize system flows and underemphasize stocks</div></li><ul><li><div>Without seeing how stocks affect their related flows through feedback processes, one cannot understand the dynamics of economic systems or the reasons for their behavior.</div></li></ul><li><div>Second, and more seriously, in trying to find statistical links that relate flows to each other, econometricians are searching for something that does not exist.</div></li></ul><li><div>Flows go up and down, on and off, in all sorts of combinations, in response to stocks, not to other flows.</div></li><li><div>Your equation would hold, however, only until something changes in the system’s structure—</div></li><li><div>You could predict tomorrow’s room temperature with your equation, as long as the system didn’t change or break down.</div></li><li><div>But if you were asked to make the room warmer, or if the room temperature suddenly started plummeting and you had to fix it, or if you wanted to produce the same room temperature with a lower fuel bill, your behavior-level analysis wouldn’t help you. You would have to dig into the system’s structure.</div></li><li><div>That’s why behavior-based econometric models are pretty good at predicting the near-term performance of the economy, quite bad at predicting the longer-term performance, and terrible at telling one how to improve the performance of the economy.</div></li></ul><li><div>Linear Minds in a Nonlinear World</div></li><ul><li><div>Nonlinear systems generally cannot be solved and cannot be added together. . . .

Nonlinearity means that the act of playing the game has a way of changing the rules. . . . That twisted changeability makes nonlinearity hard to calculate, but it also creates rich kinds of behavior that never occur in linear systems. —James Gleick, author of Chaos: Making a New Science</div></li><li><div>A linear relationship between two elements in a system can be drawn on a graph with a straight line. It’s a relationship with constant proportions.</div></li><li><div>A nonlinear relationship is one in which the cause does not produce a proportional effect. The relationship between cause and effect can only be drawn with curves or wiggles, not with a straight line</div></li><li><div>The world is full of nonlinearities.</div></li><li><div>Nonlinearities are important not only because they confound our expectations about the relationship between action and response. They are even more important because they change the relative strengths of feedback loops. They can flip a system from one mode of behavior to another.</div></li><li><div>Nonlinearities are the chief cause of the shifting dominance that characterizes several of the systems in the zoo—</div></li><li><div>Many relationships in systems are nonlinear. Their relative strengths shift in disproportionate amounts as the stocks in the system shift. Nonlinearities in feedback systems produce shifting dominance of loops and many complexities in system behavior.</div></li></ul><li><div>Nonexistent Boundaries</div></li><ul><li><div>Beware of clouds! They are prime sources of system surprises.</div></li><li><div>Clouds stand for the beginnings and ends of flows. They are stocks—sources and sinks—that are being ignored at the moment for the purposes of simplifying the present discussion. They mark the boundary of the system diagram. They rarely mark a real boundary, because systems rarely have real boundaries. Everything, as they say, is connected to everything else, and not neatly.</div></li><li><div>There are only boundaries of word, thought, perception, and social agreement—artificial, mental-model boundaries.</div></li><li><div>The greatest complexities arise exactly at boundaries.</div></li><li><div>Disorderly, mixed-up borders are sources of diversity and creativity.</div></li><li><div>Whether it is important to keep track of raw materials or consumers’ home stocks (whether it is legitimate to replace them in a diagram with clouds) depends on whether these stocks are likely to have a significant influence on the behavior of the system over the time period of interest.</div></li><li><div>In the long term, the full flow is important and, as the physical economy grows and society’s “ecological footprint” expands, the long term is increasingly coming to be the short term.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">There is no single, legitimate boundary to draw around a system.</span> We have to invent boundaries for clarity and sanity; and boundaries can produce problems when we forget that we’ve artificially created them.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">There are no separate systems. The world is a continuum. Where to draw a boundary around a system depends on the purpose of the discussion—the questions we want to ask.</span></div></li><li><div>Boundaries are of our own making, and that they can and should be reconsidered for each new discussion, problem, or purpose</div></li></ul><li><div>Layers of Limits</div></li><ul><li><div>Systems surprise us because our minds like to think about single causes neatly producing single effects.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple inputs produce multiple outputs, and virtually all of the inputs, and therefore outputs, are limited.</span></div></li><li><div>“Law of the minimum.” It doesn’t matter how much nitrogen is available to the grain, he said, if what’s short is phosphorus. It does no good to pour on more phosphorus, if the problem is low potassium.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">At any given time, the input that is most important to a system is the one that is most limiting.</span></div></li><li><div>There are layers of limits around every growing plant, child, epidemic, new product, technological advance, company, city, economy, and population. Insight comes not only from recognizing which factor is limiting, but from seeing that growth itself depletes or enhances limits and therefore changes what is limiting.</div></li><li><div>The interplay between a growing plant and the soil, a growing company and its market, a growing economy and its resource base, is dynamic. Whenever one factor ceases to be limiting, growth occurs, and the growth itself changes the relative scarcity of factors until another becomes limiting.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">To shift attention from the abundant factors to the next potential limiting factor is to gain real understanding of, and control over, the growth process.</span></div></li><li><div>Any physical entity with multiple inputs and outputs—a population, a production process, an economy—is surrounded by layers of limits. As the system develops, it interacts with and affects its own limits. The growing entity and its limited environment together form a coevolving dynamic system.</div></li><li><div>For any physical entity in a finite environment, perpetual growth is impossible. Ultimately, the choice is not to grow forever but to decide what limits to live within.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Any physical entity with multiple inputs and outputs is surrounded by layers of limits.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">There always will be limits to growth. They can be self-imposed. If they aren’t, they will be system-imposed.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Ubiquitous Delays</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Delays are ubiquitous in systems. Every stock is a delay. Most flows have delays—shipping delays, perception delays, processing delays, maturation</span></div></li><li><div>What is a significant delay depends—usually—on which set of frequencies you’re trying to understand.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Changing the length of a delay may utterly change behavior. Delays are often sensitive leverage points for policy, if they can be made shorter or longer.</span></div></li><li><div>If a decision point in a system (or a person working in that part of the system) is responding to delayed information, or responding with a delay, the decisions will be off target. Actions will be too much or too little to achieve the decision maker’s goals.</div></li><li><div>If action is taken too fast, it may nervously amplify short-term variation and create unnecessary instability.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Delays determine how fast systems can react, how accurately they hit their targets, and how timely is the information passed around a system. Overshoots, oscillations, and collapses are always caused by delays.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">When there are long delays in feedback loops, some sort of foresight is essential. To act only when a problem becomes obvious is to miss an important opportunity to solve the problem.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Bounded Rationality</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Bounded rationality means that people make quite reasonable decisions based on the information they have. But they don’t have perfect information, especially about more distant parts of the system.</span></div></li><li><div>We are not omniscient, rational optimizers, says Simon. Rather, we are blundering “satisficers,” attempting to meet (satisfy) our needs well enough (sufficiently) before moving on to the next decision.11 We do our best to further our own nearby interests in a rational way, but we can take into account only what we know. We don’t know what others are planning to do, until they do it.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">We often don’t foresee (or choose to ignore) the impacts of our actions on the whole system. So instead of finding a long term optimum, we discover within our limited purview a choice we can live with for now, and we stick to it, changing our behavior only when forced to.</span></div></li><li><div>We misperceive risk, assuming that some things are much more dangerous than they really are and others much less.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">We live in an exaggerated present—we pay too much attention to recent experience and too little attention to the past, focusing on current events rather than long term behavior.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Seeing how individual decisions are rational within the bounds of the information available does not provide an excuse for narrow-minded behavior.</span> It provides an understanding of why that behavior arises. Within the bounds of what a person in that part of the system can see and know, the behavior is reasonable.</div></li><li><div>Change comes first from stepping outside the limited information that can be seen from any single place in the system and getting an overview. From a wider perspective, information flows, goals, incentives, and disincentives can be restructured so that separate, bounded, rational actions do add up to results that everyone desires.</div></li><li><div>What makes a difference is redesigning the system to improve the information, incentives, disincentives, goals, stresses, and constraints that have an effect on specific actors.</div></li><li><div>sThe bounded rationality of each actor in a system may not lead to decisions that further the welfare of the system as a whole.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">System Traps . . . and Opportunities</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Boundaries are problem-dependent, evanescent, and messy; they are also necessary for organization and clarity.</div></li><li><div>Being less surprised by complex systems is mainly a matter of learning to expect, appreciate, and use the world’s complexity.</div></li><li><div>There are many forms of systems trouble, some of them unique, but many strikingly common. We call the system structures that produce such common patterns of problematic behavior archetypes.</div></li><li><div>Blaming, disciplining, firing, twisting policy levers harder, hoping for a more favorable sequence of driving events, tinkering at the margins—these standard responses will not fix structural problems. That is why I call these archetypes “traps.”</div></li><li><div>But system traps can be escaped—by recognizing them in advance and not getting caught in them, or by altering the structure—by reformulating goals, by weakening, strengthening, or altering feedback loops, by adding new feedback loops. That is why I call these archetypes not just traps, but opportunities.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Policy Resistance— Fixes that Fail</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Some behavior patterns that persist over long periods of time are undesirable. Despite efforts to invent technological or policy “fixes,” the system seems to be intractably stuck, producing the same behavior every year. This is the systemic trap of “fixes that fail” or “policy resistance.”</div></li><li><div>Policy resistance comes from the bounded rationalities of the actors in a system, each with his or her (or “its” in the case of an institution) own goals. Each actor monitors the state of the system with regard to some important variable—income or prices or housing or drugs or investment—and compares that state with his, her, or its goal. If there is a discrepancy, each actor does something to correct the situation. Usually the greater the discrepancy between the goal and the actual situation, the more emphatic the action will be.</div></li><li><div>Picture a single-system stock—drug supply on the city streets, for example—with various actors trying to pull that stock in different directions. Addicts want to keep it high, enforcement agencies want to keep it low, pushers want to keep it right in the middle so prices don’t get either too high or too low. The average citizen really just wants to be safe from robberies by addicts trying to get money to buy drugs. All the actors work hard to achieve their different goals. If any one actor gains an advantage and moves the system stock (drug supply) in one direction (enforcement agencies manage to cut drug imports at the border), the others double their efforts to pull it back (street prices go up, addicts have to commit more crimes to buy their daily fixes, higher prices bring more profits, suppliers use the profits to buy planes and boats to evade the border patrols).</div></li><li><div>In a policy-resistant system with actors pulling in different directions, everyone has to put great effort into keeping the system where no one wants it to be.</div></li><li><div>Intensification of anyone’s effort leads to intensification of everyone else’s</div></li><li><div>The most effective way of dealing with policy resistance is to find a way of aligning the various goals of the subsystems, usually by providing an overarching goal that allows all actors to break out of their bounded rationality. If everyone can work harmoniously toward the same outcome (if all feedback loops are serving the same goal), the results can be amazing.</div></li><li><div>THE TRAP: POLICY RESISTANCE</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">When various actors try to pull a system stock toward various goals, the result can be policy resistance.</span> Any new policy, especially if it’s effective, just pulls the stock farther from the goals of other actors and produces additional resistance, with a result that no one likes, but that everyone expends considerable effort in maintaining.</div></li></ul><li><div>THE WAY OUT</div></li><ul><li><div>Let go. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Bring in all the actors and use the energy formerly expended on resistance to seek out mutually satisfactory ways for all goals to be realized—or redefinitions of larger and more important goals that everyone can pull toward together.</span></div></li></ul></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The Tragedy of the Commons</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The trap called the tragedy of the commons comes about when there is escalation, or just simple growth, in a commonly shared, erodable environment.</span></div></li><li><div>Picture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons. . . . Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he asks, “What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?”. . . Since the herdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the positive utility is nearly +1. . . . Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all, . . . the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only a fraction of –1. . . . The rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. And another; and another. . . . But this is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each . . . is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit—in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all . . . rush, each pursuing his own best interest.</div></li><li><div>In any commons system there is, first of all, a resource that is commonly shared (the pasture). For the system to be subject to tragedy, the resource must be not only limited, but erodable when overused. That is, beyond some threshold, the less resource there is, the less it is able to regenerate itself, or the more likely it is to be destroyed.</div></li><li><div>A commons system also needs users of the resource (the cows and their owners), which have good reason to increase, and which increase at a rate that is not influenced by the condition of the commons.</div></li><li><div>The tragedy of the commons arises from missing (or too long delayed) feedback from the resource to the growth of the users of that resource.</div></li><li><div>The more users there are, the more resource is used. The more resource is used, the less there is per user. If the users follow the bounded rationality of the commons (“There’s no reason for me to be the one to limit my cows!”), there is no reason for any of them to decrease their use. Eventually, then, the harvest rate will exceed the capacity of the resource to bear the harvest. Because there is no feedback to the user, overharvesting will continue. The resource will decline. Finally, the erosion loop will kick in, the resource will be destroyed, and all the users will be ruined.</div></li><li><div>Tragedy can lurk not only in the use of common resources, but also in the use of common sinks, shared places where pollution can be dumped.</div></li><li><div>The structure of a commons system makes selfish behavior much more convenient and profitable than behavior that is responsible to the whole community and to the future.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Three ways to avoid the tragedy of the commons.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Educate and exhort.</span> Help people to see the consequences of unrestrained use of the commons.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Privatize the commons.</span> Divide it up, so that each person reaps the consequences of his or her own actions. If some people lack the self-control to stay below the carrying capacity of their own private resource, those people will harm only themselves and not others.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Regulate the commons.</span> Garrett Hardin calls this option, bluntly, “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon.” Regulation can take many forms, from outright bans on certain behaviors to quotas, permits, taxes, incentives. To be effective, regulation must be enforced by policing and penalties.</div></li></ul><li><div>Common resources protected only by tradition or an “honor system” may attract those who do not respect the tradition or who have no honor.</div></li><li><div>Many resources, such as the atmosphere and the fish of the sea, simply cannot be privatized.</div></li><li><div>Privatization works more reliably than exhortation, if society is willing to let some individuals learn the hard way. But many resources, such as the atmosphere and the fish of the sea, simply cannot be privatized.</div></li><li><div>Notice from these examples how many different forms “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon” can take. The traffic light doles out access to the commons on a “take your turn” basis. The meters charge for use of the parking commons. The bank uses physical barriers and strong penal ties. Permits to use broadcasting frequencies are issued to applicants by a government agency. And garbage fees directly restore the missing feedback, letting each household feel the economic impact of its own use of the commons.</div></li><li><div>THE TRAP: TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">When there is a commonly shared resource, every user benefits directly from its use, but shares the costs of its abuse with everyone else. Therefore, there is very weak feedback from the condition of the resource to the decisions of the resource users.

The lower the desired state, the less discrepancy, and the less corrective action is taken. The less corrective action, the lower the system state. If this loop is allowed to run unchecked, it can lead to a continuous degradation in the system’s performance.</span></div></li><li><div>Another name for this system trap is “eroding goals.” It is also called the “boiled frog syndrome,”</div></li><li><div>There are two antidotes to eroding goals. One is to keep standards absolute, regardless of performance.

Escalation comes from a reinforcing loop set up by competing actors trying to get ahead of each other.</span></div></li><li><div>Escalation is not just keeping up with the Joneses, but keeping slightly ahead of the Joneses. The United States and the Soviet Union for years exaggerated their reports of each other’s armaments in order to justify more armaments of their own.</div></li><li><div>Negative campaigning is another perverse example of escalation. One candidate smears another, so the other smears back, and so forth,</div></li><li><div>Price wars, with one economic competitor underpricing another, which causes the other to cut prices more, which causes the first to cut prices yet again, until both sides are losing money,</div></li><li><div>Even escalating in a good direction can be a problem, because it isn’t easy to stop. Each hospital trying to outdo the others in up-to-date, powerful, expensive diagnostic machines can lead to out-of-sight health care costs.</div></li><li><div>Escalation, being a reinforcing feedback loop, builds exponentially.</div></li><li><div>One way out of the escalation trap is unilateral disarmament—deliberately reducing your own system state to induce reductions in your state.</div></li><li><div>The only other graceful way out of the escalation system is to negotiate a disarmament. That’s a structural change, an exercise in system design. It creates a new set of balancing controlling loops to keep the competition in bounds (parental pressure to stop the kids’ fight; regulations on the size and placement of advertisements; peace-keeping troops in violence-prone areas).</div></li><li><div>THE TRAP: ESCALATION</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">When the state of one stock is determined by trying to surpass the state of another stock—and vice versa—then there is a reinforcing feedback loop carrying the system into an arms race, a wealth race, a smear campaign, escalating loudness, escalating violence.</span> The escalation is exponential and can lead to extremes surprisingly quickly. If nothing is done, the spiral will be stopped by someone’s collapse—because exponential growth cannot go on forever.</div></li></ul><li><div>THE WAY OUT</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The best way out of this trap is to avoid getting in it</span>. If caught in an escalating system, one can refuse to compete (unilaterally disarm), thereby interrupting the reinforcing loop.

That’s a reinforcing feedback loop, which rapidly divides a system into winners who go on winning, and losers who go on losing.</div></li><li><div>“The competitive exclusion principle.” This principle says that two different species cannot live in exactly the same ecological niche, competing for exactly the same resources.</div></li><li><div>It will not only dominate the niche, it will drive the losing competitor to extinction. That will happen not by direct confrontation usually, but by appropriating all the resource, leaving none for the weaker competitor.</div></li><li><div>Species and companies sometimes escape competitive exclusion by diversifying. A species can learn or evolve to exploit new resources. A company can create a new product or service that does not directly compete with existing ones.</div></li><li><div>Diversification is not guaranteed, however, especially if the monopolizing firm (or species) has the power to crush all offshoots, or buy them up, or deprive them of the resources they need to stay alive. Diversification doesn’t work as a strategy for the poor.</div></li><li><div>The most obvious way out of the success-to the-successful archetype is by periodically “leveling the playing field.” Traditional societies and game designers instinctively design into their systems some way of equalizing advantages, so the game stays fair and interesting.</div></li><li><div>The success-to the-successful loop can be kept under control by putting into place feedback loops that keep any competitor from taking over entirely.</div></li><li><div>The most obvious way out of the success-to the-successful archetype is by periodically “leveling the playing field.” Traditional societies and game designers instinctively design into their systems some way of equalizing advantages, so the game stays fair and interesting.</div></li><li><div>These equalizing mechanisms may derive from simple morality, or they may come from the practical understanding that losers, if they are unable to get out of the game of success to the successful, and if they have no hope of winning, could get frustrated enough to destroy the playing field.</div></li><li><div>THE TRAP: SUCCESS TO THE SUCCESSFUL</div></li><ul><li><div>If the winners of a competition are systematically rewarded with the means to win again, a reinforcing feedback loop is created by which, if it is allowed to proceed uninhibited, the winners eventually take all, while the losers are eliminated.</div></li></ul><li><div>THE WAY OUT</div></li><ul><li><div>Diversification, which allows those who are losing the competition to get out of that game and start another one; strict limitation on the fraction of the pie any one winner may win (antitrust laws); policies that level the playing field, removing some of the advantage of the strongest players or increasing the advantage of the weakest; policies that devise rewards for success that do not bias the next round of competition.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Shifting the Burden to the Intervenor— Addiction</span></div></li><ul><li><div>This trap is known by many names: addiction, dependence, shifting the burden to the intervenor. The structure includes a stock with in-flows and out-flows. The stock can be physical (a crop of corn) or meta-physical (a sense of well-being or self-worth). The stock is maintained by an actor adjusting a balancing feedback loop—either altering the in-flows or outflows. The actor has a goal and compares it with a perception of the actual state of the stock to determine what action to take.</div></li><li><div>Shifting a burden to an intervenor can be a good thing. It often is done purposefully, and the result can be an increased ability to keep the system in a desirable state.</div></li><li><div>But the intervention can become a system trap.</div></li><li><div>The trap is formed if the intervention, whether by active destruction or simple neglect, undermines the original capacity of the system to maintain itself. If that capability atrophies, then more of the intervention is needed to achieve the desired effect. That weakens the capability of the original system still more. The intervenor picks up the slack. And so forth.</div></li><li><div>One definition of addiction used in Alcoholics Anonymous is repeating the same stupid behavior over and over and over, and somehow expecting different results.</div></li><li><div>Addiction is finding a quick and dirty solution to the symptom of the problem, which prevents or distracts one from the harder and longer-term task of solving the real problem. Addictive policies are insidious, because they are so easy to sell, so simple to fall for.</div></li><li><div>Addiction is finding a quick and dirty solution to the symptom of the problem, which prevents or distracts one from the harder and longer-term task of solving the real problem. Addictive policies are insidious, because they are so easy to sell, so simple to fall for.</div></li><li><div>Breaking an addiction is painful.</div></li><li><div>Withdrawal means finally confronting the real (and usually much deteriorated) state of the system and taking the actions that the addiction allowed one to put off.</div></li><li><div>It’s worth going through the withdrawal to get back to an unaddicted state, but it is far preferable to avoid addiction in the first place.</div></li><li><div>The problem can be avoided up front by intervening in such a way as to strengthen the ability of the system to shoulder its own burdens. This option, helping the system to help itself, can be much cheaper and easier than taking over and running the system—</div></li><li><div>Why are the natural correction mechanisms failing? • How can obstacles to their success be removed? • How can mechanisms for their success be made more effective?</div></li><li><div>THE TRAP: SHIFTING THE BURDEN TO THE INTERVENOR</div></li><ul><li><div>Shifting the burden, dependence, and addiction arise when a solution to a systemic problem reduces (or disguises) the symptoms, but does nothing to solve the underlying problem. Whether it is a substance that dulls one’s perception or a policy that hides the underlying trouble, the drug of choice interferes with the actions that could solve the real problem.</div></li><li><div>If the intervention designed to correct the problem causes the self-maintaining capacity of the original system to atrophy or erode, then a destructive reinforcing feedback loop is set in motion. The system deteriorates; more and more of the solution is then required.</div></li></ul><li><div>THE WAY OUT</div></li><ul><li><div>Again, the best way out of this trap is to avoid getting in. Beware of symptom-relieving or signal-denying policies or practices that don’t really address the problem. Take the focus off short-term relief and put it on long term restructuring.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Rule Beating</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Rule beating means evasive action to get around the intent of a system’s rules—abiding by the letter, but not the spirit, of the law.</div></li><li><div>There are two generic responses to rule beating. One is to try to stamp out the self-organizing response by strengthening the rules or their enforcement—usually giving rise to still greater system distortion. That’s the way further into the trap.</div></li><li><div>The way out of the trap, the opportunity, is to understand rule beating as useful feedback, and to revise, improve, rescind, or better explain the rules. Designing rules better means foreseeing as far as possible the effects of the rules on the subsystems, including any rule beating they might engage in, and structuring the rules to turn the self-organizing capabilities of the system in a positive direction.</div></li><li><div>THE TRAP: RULE BEATING</div></li><ul><li><div>Rules to govern a system can lead to rule beating—perverse behavior that gives the appearance of obeying the rules or achieving the goals, but that actually distorts the system.</div></li></ul><li><div>THE WAY OUT</div></li><ul><li><div>Design, or redesign, rules to release creativity not in the direction of beating the rules, but in the direction of achieving the purpose of the rules.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Seeking the Wrong Goal</span></div></li><ul><li><div>One of the most powerful ways to influence the behavior of a system is through its purpose or goal. That’s because the goal is the direction-setter of the system, the definer of discrepancies that require action, the indicator of compliance, failure, or success toward which balancing feedback loops work.</div></li><li><div>If the goal is defined badly, if it doesn’t measure what it’s supposed to measure, if it doesn’t reflect the real welfare of the system, then the system can’t possibly produce a desirable result.</div></li><li><div>Systems, like the three wishes in the traditional fairy tale, have a terrible tendency to produce exactly and only what you ask them to produce. Be careful what you ask them to produce.</div></li><li><div>confuse effort with result, one of the most common mistakes in designing systems around the wrong goal.</div></li><li><div>Seeking the wrong goal, satisfying the wrong indicator, is a system characteristic almost opposite from rule beating. In rule beating, the system is out to evade an unpopular or badly designed rule, while giving the appearance of obeying it. In seeking the wrong goal, the system obediently follows the rule and produces its specified result—which is not necessarily what anyone actually wants.</div></li><li><div>Both of these system perversions can be going on at the same time with regard to the same rule.</div></li><li><div>THE TRAP: SEEKING THE WRONG GOAL</div></li><ul><li><div>System behavior is particularly sensitive to the goals of feedback loops. If the goals—the indicators of satisfaction of the rules—are defined inaccurately or incompletely, the system may obediently work to produce a result that is not really intended or wanted.</div></li></ul><li><div>THE WAY OUT</div></li><ul><li><div>Specify indicators and goals that reflect the real welfare of the system.

What is needed is much slower growth, very different kinds of growth, and in some cases no growth or negative growth.</div></li><li><div>The world’s leaders are correctly fixated on economic growth as the answer to virtually all problems, but they’re pushing with all their might in the wrong direction.</div></li><li><div>Leverage points frequently are not intuitive.

Numbers—Constants and parameters such as subsidies, taxes, standards</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Putting different hands on the faucets may change the rate at which the faucets turn, but if they’re the same old faucets, plumbed into the same old system, turned according to the same old information and goals and rules, the system behavior isn’t going to change much.</div></li><li><div>The size of the flows is a matter of numbers and how quickly those numbers can be changed. Maybe the faucet turns hard, so it takes a while to get the water flowing or to turn it off. Maybe the drain is blocked and can allow only a small flow, no matter how open it is. Maybe the faucet can deliver with the force of a fire hose. Some of these kinds of parameters are physically locked in and unchangeable, but many can be varied and so are popular intervention points.</div></li><li><div>Numbers, the sizes of flows, are dead last on my list of powerful interventions. Diddling with the details, arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Probably 90—no 95, no 99 percent—of our attention goes to parameters, but there’s not a lot of leverage in them.</div></li><li><div>Parameters become leverage points when they go into ranges that kick off one of the items higher on this list. Interest rates, for example, or birth rates, control the gains around reinforcing feedback loops. System goals are parameters that can make big differences.</div></li><li><div>Most systems have evolved or are designed to stay far out of range of critical parameters.</div></li><li><div>dynamics, published in 1969, which demonstrated that subsidized low-income housing is a leverage point.3 World Bank, The less of it there is, the better off the city is—even the low-income folks in the city. This model came out at a time when national policy dictated massive low-income housing projects, and Forrester was derided. Since then, many of those projects have been torn down in city after city. Counterintuitive—that’s Forrester’s word to describe complex systems. Leverage points frequently are not intuitive. Or if they are, we too often use them backward, systematically worsening whatever problems we are trying to solve. I have come up with no quick or easy formulas for finding leverage points in complex and dynamic systems. Give me a few months or years and I’ll figure it out. And I know from bitter experience that, because they are so counterintuitive, when I do discover a system’s leverage points, hardly anybody will believe me. Very frustrating—especially for those of us who yearn not just to understand complex systems, but to make the world work better.

Buffers—The sizes of stabilizing stocks relative to their flows</span></div></li><ul><li><div>You hear about catastrophic river floods much more often than catastrophic lake floods, because stocks that are big, relative to their flows, are more stable than small ones. In chemistry and other fields, a big, stabilizing stock is known as a buffer.</div></li><li><div>You can often stabilize a system by increasing the capacity of a buffer.5 But if a buffer is too big, the system gets inflexible. It reacts too slowly.</div></li><li><div>big buffers of some sorts, such as water reservoirs or inventories, cost a lot to build or maintain. Businesses invented just-in-time inventories, because occasional vulnerability to fluctuations or screw-ups is cheaper (for them, anyway) than certain, constant inventory costs—and because small-to vanishing inventories allow more flexible response to shifting demand.</div></li><li><div>There’s leverage, sometimes magical, in changing the size of buffers. But buffers are usually physical entities, not easy to change.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">10. Stock-and-Flow Structures—Physical systems and their nodes of intersection</span></div></li><ul><li><div>The plumbing structure, the stocks and flows and their physical arrangement, can have an enormous effect on how the system operates.</div></li><li><div>The only way to fix a system that is laid out poorly is to rebuild it, if you can.</div></li><li><div>But often physical rebuilding is the slowest and most expensive kind of change to make in a system. Some stock-and-flow structures are just plain unchangeable.</div></li><li><div>an inefficient car fleet takes ten to twenty years to turn over.</div></li><li><div>Physical structure is crucial in a system, but is rarely a leverage point, because changing it is rarely quick or simple.</div></li><li><div>The leverage point is in proper design in the first place. After the structure is built, the leverage is in understanding its limitations and bottlenecks, using it with maximum efficiency, and refraining from fluctuations or expansions that strain its capacity.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">9. Delays—The lengths of time relative to the rates of system changes</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Delays in feedback loops are critical determinants of system behavior. They are common causes of oscillations.</div></li><li><div>If you’re trying to adjust a stock (your store inventory) to meet your goal, but you receive only delayed information about what the state of the stock is, you will overshoot and undershoot your goal. The same is true if your information is timely, but your response isn’t.</div></li><li><div>A system just can’t respond to short-term changes when it has long term delays.</div></li><li><div>A delay in a feedback process is critical relative to rates of change in the stocks that the feedback loop is trying to control.</div></li><li><div>Delays that are too short cause overreaction, “chasing your tail,” oscillations amplified by the jumpiness of the response. Delays that are too long cause damped, sustained, or exploding oscillations, depending on how much too long. Overlong delays in a system with a threshold, a danger point, a range past which irreversible damage can occur, cause overshoot and collapse.</div></li><li><div>I would list delay length as a high leverage point, except for the fact that delays are not often easily changeable. Things take as long as they take.</div></li><li><div>It’s usually easier to slow down the change rate, so that inevitable feedback delays won’t cause so much trouble. That’s why growth rates are higher up on the leverage point list than delay times.</div></li><li><div>There’s more leverage in slowing the system down so technologies and prices can keep up with it, than there is in wishing the delays would go away.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">8. Balancing Feedback Loops—The strength of the feedbacks relative to the impacts they are trying to correct</span></div></li><ul><li><div>beginning to move from the physical part of the system to the information and control parts, where more leverage can be found.</div></li><li><div>Balancing feedback loops are ubiquitous in systems. Nature evolves them and humans invent them as controls to keep important stocks within safe bounds.</div></li><li><div>Any balancing feedback loop needs a goal (the thermostat setting), a monitoring and signaling device to detect deviation from the goal (the thermostat), and a response mechanism (the furnace and/or air conditioner, fans, pumps, pipes, fuel, etc.).</div></li><li><div>A complex system usually has numerous balancing feedback loops it can bring into play, so it can self-correct under different conditions and impacts. Some of those loops may be inactive much of the time—like the emergency cooling system in a nuclear power plant,</div></li><li><div>One of the big mistakes we make is to strip away these “emergency” response mechanisms because they aren’t often used and they appear to be costly. In the short term, we see no effect from doing this. In the long term, we drastically narrow the range of conditions over which the system can survive.</div></li><li><div>The strength of a balancing loop—its ability to keep its appointed stock at or near its goal—depends on the combination of all its parameters and links—the accuracy and rapidity of monitoring, the quickness and power of response, the directness and size of corrective flows. Sometimes there are leverage points here.</div></li><li><div>The strength of a balancing feedback loop is important relative to the impact it is designed to correct. If the impact increases in strength, the feedbacks have to be strengthened too.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">7. Reinforcing Feedback Loops—The strength of the gain of driving loops</span></div></li><ul><li><div>A balancing feedback loop is self-correcting; a reinforcing feedback loop is self-reinforcing. The more it works, the more it gains power to work some more, driving system behavior in one direction.</div></li><li><div>Reinforcing feedback loops are sources of growth, explosion, erosion, and collapse in systems. A system with an unchecked reinforcing loop ultimately will destroy itself. That’s why there are so few of them. Usually a balancing loop will kick in sooner or later.</div></li><li><div>The more people catch the flu, the more they infect other people.</div></li><li><div>The epidemic will run out of infectible people—or people will take increasingly stronger steps to avoid being infected.</div></li><li><div>the first outcome is what will happen if the reinforcing loop runs its course, the second is what will happen if there’s an intervention to reduce its self-multiplying power.</div></li><li><div>Reducing the gain around a reinforcing loop—slowing the growth—is usually a more powerful leverage point in systems than strengthening balancing loops, and far more preferable than letting the reinforcing loop run.</div></li><li><div>Population and economic growth rates in the World model are leverage points, because slowing them gives the many balancing loops, through technology and markets and other forms of adaptation (all of which have limits and delays), time to function.</div></li><li><div>There are many reinforcing feedback loops in society that reward the winners of a competition with the resources to win even bigger next time—the “success to the successful” trap. Rich people collect interest; poor people pay it. Rich people pay accountants and lean on politicians to reduce their taxes; poor people can’t. Rich people give their kids inheritances and good educations. Antipoverty programs are weak balancing loops that try to counter these strong reinforcing ones. It would be much more effective to weaken the reinforcing loops. That’s what progressive income tax, inheritance tax, and universal high-quality public education programs are meant to do. If the wealthy can influence government to weaken, rather than strengthen, those measures, then the government itself shifts from a balancing structure to one that reinforces success to the successful!</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">6. Information Flows—The structure of who does and does not have access to information</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Missing information flows is one of the most common causes of system malfunction. Adding or restoring information can be a powerful intervention, usually much easier and cheaper than rebuilding physical infrastructure. The tragedy of the commons that is crashing the world’s commercial fisheries occurs because there is little feedback from the state of the fish population to the decision to invest in fishing vessels.</div></li><li><div>It’s important that the missing feedback be restored to the right place and in compelling form.</div></li><li><div>To take another tragedy of the commons example, it’s not enough to inform all the users of an aquifer that the groundwater level is dropping. That could initiate a race to the bottom. It would be more effective to set the cost of water to rise steeply as the pumping rate begins to exceed the recharge rate.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">5. Rules—Incentives, punishments, constraints</span></div></li><ul><li><div>The rules of the system define its scope, its boundaries, its degrees of freedom.</div></li><li><div>Physical laws such as the second law of thermodynamics are absolute rules, whether we understand them or not or like them or not. Laws, punishments, incentives, and informal social agreements are progressively weaker rules.</div></li><li><div>They are high leverage points. Power over the rules is real power.</div></li><li><div>the Supreme Court, which interprets and delineates the Constitution—the rules for writing the rules—has even more power than Congress.</div></li><li><div>If you want to understand the deepest malfunctions of systems, pay attention to the rules and to who has power over them.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">4. Self-Organization—The power to add, change, or evolve system structure</span></div></li><ul><li><div>The most stunning thing living systems and some social systems can do is to change themselves utterly by creating whole new structures and behaviors. In biological systems that power is called evolution. In human economies it’s called technical advance or social revolution. In systems lingo it’s called self-organization.</div></li><li><div>Self-organization means changing any aspect of a system lower on this list—adding completely new physical structures, such as brains or wings or computers—adding new balancing or reinforcing loops, or new rules. The ability to self-organize is the strongest form of system resilience. A system that can evolve can survive almost any change, by changing itself.</div></li><li><div>Insistence on a single culture shuts down learning and cuts back resilience. Any system, biological, economic, or social, that gets so encrusted that it cannot self-evolve, a system that systematically scorns experimentation and wipes out the raw material of innovation, is doomed over the long term on this highly variable planet.</div></li><li><div>Encouraging variability and experimentation and diversity means “losing control.”</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">3. Goals—The purpose or function of the system</span></div></li><ul><li><div>the goal of a system is a leverage point superior to the self-organizing ability of a system. If the goal is to bring more and more of the world under the control of one particular central planning system (the empire of Genghis Khan, the Church, the People’s Republic of China, Wal-Mart, Disney), then everything further down the list, physical stocks and flows, feedback loops, information flows, even self-organizing behavior, will be twisted to conform to that goal.</div></li><li><div>whether genetic engineering is a “good” or a “bad” thing.

Actually it’s the goal of every living population—and only a bad one when it isn’t balanced by higher level balancing feedback loops that never let an upstart power-loop-driven entity control the world.</div></li><li><div>The goal of keeping the market competitive has to trump the goal of each individual corporation to eliminate its competitors, just as in ecosystems, the goal of keeping populations in balance and evolving has to trump the goal of each population to reproduce without limit.</div></li><li><div>changing the players in the system is a low-level intervention, as long as the players fit into the same old system. The exception to that rule is at the top, where a single player can have the power to change the system’s goal.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">2. Paradigms—The mind-set out of which the system—its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters—arises</span></div></li><ul><li><div>The shared idea in the minds of society, the great big unstated assumptions, constitute that society’s paradigm, or deepest set of beliefs about how the world works. These beliefs are unstated because it is unnecessary to state them—everyone already knows them.</div></li><li><div>Paradigms are the sources of systems. From them, from shared social agreements about the nature of reality, come system goals and information flows, feedbacks, stocks, flows, and everything else about systems.</div></li><li><div>Whether it was Copernicus and Kepler showing that the earth is not the center of the universe, or Einstein hypothesizing that matter and energy are interchangeable, or Adam Smith postulating that the selfish actions of individual players in markets wonderfully accumulate to the common good, people who have managed to intervene in systems at the level of paradigm have hit a leverage point that totally transforms systems.</div></li><li><div>You could say paradigms are harder to change than anything else about a system, and therefore this item should be lowest on the list, not second to- highest. But there’s nothing physical or expensive or even slow in the process of paradigm change.</div></li><li><div>In a single individual it can happen in a millisecond. All it takes is a click in the mind, a falling of scales from the eyes, a new way of seeing. Whole societies are another matter—they resist challenges to their paradigms harder than they resist anything else.</div></li><li><div>how do you change paradigms?</div></li><li><div>You keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm. You keep speaking and acting, loudly and with assurance, from the new one. You insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power. You don’t waste time with reactionaries; rather, you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">1. Transcending Paradigms</span></div></li><ul><li><div>There is yet one leverage point that is even higher than changing a paradigm. That is to keep oneself unattached in the arena of paradigms, to stay flexible, to realize that no paradigm is “true,” that every one, including the one that sweetly shapes your own worldview, is a tremendously limited understanding of an immense and amazing universe that is far beyond human comprehension.</div></li><li><div>If no paradigm is right, you can choose whatever one will help to achieve your purpose. If you have no idea where to get a purpose, you can listen to the universe.</div></li><li><div>The higher the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it—that’s why societies often rub out truly enlightened beings.</div></li><li><div>Magical leverage points are not easily accessible, even if we know where they are and which direction to push on them. There are no cheap tickets to mastery.</div></li><li><div>In the end, it seems that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with strategically, profoundly, madly, letting go and dancing with the system.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Living in a World of Systems</span></div></li><ul><li><div>The real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable world, nor even that it is a reasonable one. The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite. Life is not an illogicality; yet it is a trap for logicians. It looks just a little more mathematical and regular than it is. —G. K. Chesterton,1 20th century writer</div></li><li><div>It’s one thing to under stand how to fix a system and quite another to wade in and fix it.</div></li><li><div>Social systems are the external manifestations of cultural thinking patterns and of profound human needs, emotions, strengths, and weaknesses. Changing them is not as simple as saying “now all change,” or of trusting that he who knows the good shall do the good.</div></li><li><div>Our systems insights helped us understand many things we hadn’t understood before, but they didn’t help us understand everything.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">A systems insight . . . can raise more questions!</span></div></li><li><div>The tool of systems thinking, born out of engineering and mathematics, implemented in computers, drawn from a mechanistic mind-set and a quest for prediction and control, leads its practitioners, inexorably I believe, to confront the most deeply human mysteries.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Self-organizing, nonlinear, feedback systems are inherently unpredictable. They are not controllable. They are understandable only in the most general way.</span></div></li><li><div>The goal of foreseeing the future exactly and preparing for it perfectly is unrealizable.</div></li><li><div>The idea of making a complex system do just what you want it to do can be achieved only temporarily, at best.</div></li><li><div>For any objective other than the most trivial, we can’t optimize; we don’t even know what to optimize.</div></li><li><div>Why do people actively sort and screen information the way they do? How do they determine what to let in and what to let bounce off, what to reckon with and what to ignore or disparage? How is it that, exposed to the same information, different people absorb different messages, and draw different conclusions?</div></li><li><div>Are they universal, or culturally determined? What causes a person or a society to give up on attaining “real values” and to settle for cheap substitutes? How can you key a feedback loop to qualities you can’t measure, rather than to quantities you can?</div></li><li><div>It says that there is plenty to do, of a different sort of “doing.” The future can’t be predicted, but it can be envisioned and brought lovingly into being. Systems can’t be controlled, but they can be designed and redesigned. We can’t surge forward with certainty into a world of no surprises, but we can expect surprises and learn from them and even profit from them. We can’t impose our will on a system. We can listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone.</div></li><li><div>We can’t control systems or figure them out. But we can dance with them!</div></li><li><div>Get the Beat of the System</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Before you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves.</span></div></li><li><div>Learn its history. Ask people who’ve been around a long time to tell you what has happened.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Starting with the behavior of the system forces you to focus on facts, not theories. It keeps you from falling too quickly into your own beliefs or misconceptions, or those of others.</span></div></li><li><div>It’s especially interesting to watch how the various elements in the system do or do not vary together.</div></li><li><div>Starting with the behavior of the system directs one’s thoughts to dynamic, not static, analysis—not only to “What’s wrong?” but also to “How did we get there?” “What other behavior modes are possible?” “If we don’t change direction, where are we going to end up?” And looking to the strengths of the system, one can ask “What’s working well here?”</div></li><li><div>Starting with the history of several variables plotted together begins to suggest not only what elements are in the system, but how they might be interconnected.</div></li><li><div>Starting with history discourages the common and distracting tendency we all have to define a problem not by the system’s actual behavior, but by the lack of our favorite solution.</div></li></ul><li><div>Expose Your Mental Models to the Light of Day</div></li><ul><li><div>When we draw structural diagrams and then write equations, we are forced to make our assumptions visible and to express them with rigor.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Our models have to be complete, and they have to add up, and they have to be consistent.</span></div></li><li><div>Mental flexibility—the willingness to redraw boundaries, to notice that a system has shifted into a new mode, to see how to redesign structure—is a necessity when you live in a world of flexible systems.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own. </span>Instead of becoming a champion for one possible explanation or hypothesis or model, collect as many as possible. Consider all of them to be plausible until you find some evidence that causes you to rule one out. That way you will be emotionally able to see the evidence that rules out an assumption that may become entangled with your own identity.</div></li><li><div>Getting models out into the light of day, making them as rigorous as possible, testing them against the evidence, and being willing to scuttle them if they are no longer supported is nothing more than practicing the scientific method—</div></li></ul><li><div>Honor, Respect, and Distribute Information</div></li><ul><li><div>Decision makers can’t respond to information they don’t have, can’t respond accurately to information that is inaccurate, and can’t respond in a timely way to information that is late. I would guess that most of what goes wrong in systems goes wrong because of biased, late, or missing information.</div></li><li><div>You can drive a system crazy by muddying its information streams. You can make a system work better with surprising ease if you can give it more timely, more accurate, more complete information.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Information is power. Anyone interested in power grasps that idea very quickly.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Use Language with Care and Enrich It with Systems Concepts</div></li><ul><li><div>Honoring information means above all avoiding language pollution—making the cleanest possible use we can of language. Second, it means expanding our language so we can talk about complexity.</div></li><li><div>Language can serve as a medium through which we create new understandings and new realities as we begin to talk about them. In fact, we don’t talk about what we see; we see only what we can talk about.</div></li><li><div>Our perspectives on the world depend on the interaction of our nervous system and our language—both act as filters through which we perceive our world.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The language and information systems of an organization are not an objective means of describing an outside reality—they fundamentally structure the perceptions and actions of its members.</span></div></li><li><div>To reshape the measurement and communication systems of a [society] is to reshape all potential interactions at the most fundamental level.</div></li><li><div>A society that talks incessantly about “productivity” but that hardly understands, much less uses, the word “resilience” is going to become productive and not resilient. A society that doesn’t understand or use the term “carrying capacity” will exceed its carrying capacity.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The first step in respecting language is keeping it as concrete, meaningful, and truthful as possible—part of the job of keeping information streams clear. The second step is to enlarge language to make it consistent with our enlarged understanding of systems.</span></div></li><li><div>The industrial society is just beginning to have and use words for systems, because it is only beginning to pay attention to and use complexity. Carrying capacity, structure, diversity, and even system are old words that are coming to have richer and more precise meanings.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Attention to What Is Important, Not Just What Is Quantifiable</span></div></li><ul><li><div>If quantity forms the goals of our feedback loops, if quantity is the center of our attention and language and institutions, if we motivate ourselves, rate ourselves, and reward ourselves on our ability to produce quantity, then quantity will be the result.</div></li><li><div>Pretending that something doesn’t exist if it’s hard to quantify leads to faulty models.</div></li><li><div>Human beings have been endowed not only with the ability to count, but also with the ability to assess quality. Be a quality detector.</div></li><li><div>Don’t be stopped by the “if you can’t define it and measure it, I don’t have to pay attention to it” ploy. No one can define or measure justice, democracy, security, freedom, truth, or love</div></li></ul><li><div>Make Feedback Policies for Feedback Systems</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">It’s easier, more effective, and usually much cheaper to design policies that change depending on the state of the system.</span> Especially where there are great uncertainties, the best policies not only contain feedback loops, but meta-feedback loops—loops that alter, correct, and expand loops. These are policies that design learning into the management process.</div></li></ul><li><div>Go for the Good of the Whole</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Remember that hierarchies exist to serve the bottom layers, not the top. Don’t maximize parts of systems or subsystems while ignoring the whole.</span></div></li><li><div>Don’t, as Kenneth Boulding once said, go to great trouble to optimize something that never should be done at all.</div></li><li><div>Aim to enhance total systems properties, such as growth, stability, diversity, resilience, and sustainability—whether they are easily measured or not.</div></li></ul><li><div>Listen to the Wisdom of the System</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Aid and encourage the forces and structures that help the system run itself.</span></div></li><li><div>Don’t be an unthinking intervenor and destroy the system’s own self-maintenance capacities.</div></li><li><div>Before you charge in to make things better, pay attention to the value of what’s already there.</div></li></ul><li><div>Locate Responsibility in the System</div></li><ul><li><div>A guideline both for analysis and design.</div></li><li><div>In analysis, it means looking for the ways the system creates its own behavior. Do pay attention to the triggering events, the outside influences that bring forth one kind of behavior from the system rather than another.</div></li><li><div>Sometimes those outside events can be controlled but sometimes they can’t. Sometimes blaming or trying to control the outside influence blinds one to the easier task of increasing responsibility within the system.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“Intrinsic responsibility” means that the system is designed to send feedback about the consequences of decision making directly and quickly and compellingly to the decision makers.</span> Because the pilot of a plane rides in the front of the plane, that pilot is intrinsically responsible. He or she will experience directly the consequences of his or her decisions.</div></li><li><div>Designing a system for intrinsic responsibility could mean, for example, requiring all towns or companies that emit wastewater into a stream to place their intake pipes downstream from their outflow pipe.</div></li><li><div>A great deal of responsibility was lost when rulers who declared war were no longer expected to lead the troops into battle. Warfare became even more irresponsible when it became possible to push a button and cause tremendous damage at such a distance that the person pushing the button never even sees the damage.</div></li><li><div>How little our current culture has come to look for responsibility within the system that generates an action, and how poorly we design systems to experience the consequences of their actions.</div></li></ul><li><div>Stay Humble— Stay a Learner</div></li><ul><li><div>Working with systems, on the computer, in nature, among people, in organizations, constantly reminds me of how incomplete my mental models are, how complex the world is, and how much I don’t know.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The thing to do, when you don’t know, is not to bluff and not to freeze, but to learn.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">In a world of complex systems, it is not appropriate to charge forward with rigid, undeviating directives.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">What’s appropriate when you’re learning is small steps, constant monitoring, and a willingness to change course as you find out more about where it’s leading.</span></div></li><li><div>It means making mistakes and, worse, admitting them. It means what psychologist Don Michael calls “error-embracing.” It takes a lot of courage to embrace your errors.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Error-embracing is the condition for learning. It means seeking and using—and sharing—information about what went wrong with what you expected or hoped would go right.</span> Both error embracing and living with high levels of uncertainty emphasize our personal as well as societal vulnerability. Typically we hide our vulnerabilities from ourselves as well as from others. But . . . to be the kind of person who truly accepts his responsibility . . . requires knowledge of and access to self far beyond that possessed by most people in this society.</div></li></ul><li><div>Celebrate Complexity</div></li><ul><li><div>The universe is messy. It is nonlinear, turbulent, and dynamic. It spends its time in transient behavior on its way to somewhere else, not in mathematically neat equilibria. It self-organizes and evolves. It creates diversity and uniformity. That’s what makes the world interesting, that’s what makes it beautiful, and that’s what makes it work.</div></li><li><div>We can, and some of us do, celebrate and encourage self-organization, disorder, variety, and diversity. Some of us even make a moral code of doing so, as Aldo Leopold did with his land ethic: “A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.”</div></li></ul><li><div>Expand Time Horizons</div></li><ul><li><div>One of the worst ideas humanity ever had was the interest rate, which led to the further ideas of payback periods and discount rates, all of which provide a rational, quantitative excuse for ignoring the long term. The official time horizon of industrial society doesn’t extend beyond what will happen after the next election or beyond the payback period of current investments.</div></li><li><div>The time horizon of most families still extends farther than that—through the lifetimes of children or grandchildren.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The longer the operant time horizon, the better the chances for survival.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Phenomena at different time-scales are nested within each other. Actions taken now have some immediate effects and some that radiate out for decades to come. We experience now the consequences of actions set in motion yesterday and decades ago and centuries ago.</span></div></li><li><div>The couplings between very fast processes and very slow ones are sometimes strong, sometimes weak. When the slow ones dominate, nothing seems to be happening; when the fast ones take over, things happen with breathtaking speed. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Systems are always coupling and uncoupling the large and the small, the fast and the slow.</span></div></li><li><div>When you’re walking along a tricky, curving, unknown, surprising, obstacle-strewn path, you’d be a fool to keep your head down and look just at the next step in front of you. You’d be equally a fool just to peer far ahead and never notice what’s immediately under your feet. You need to be watching both the short and the long term—the whole system.</div></li></ul><li><div>Defy the Disciplines</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Seeing systems whole requires more than being “interdisciplinary,”</span> if that word means, as it usually does, putting together people from different disciplines and letting them talk past each other.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Interdisciplinary communication works only if there is a real problem to be solved, and if the representatives from the various disciplines are more committed to solving the problem than to being academically correct. They will have to go into learning mode. They will have to admit ignorance and be willing to be taught, by each other and by the system.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Expand the Boundary of Caring</div></li><ul><li><div>Living successfully in a world of complex systems means expanding not only time horizons and thought horizons; above all, it means expanding the horizons of caring.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The real system is interconnected. No part of the human race is separate either from other human beings or from the global ecosystem</span></div></li><li><div>It will not be possible in this integrated world for your heart to succeed if your lungs fail, or for your company to succeed if your workers fail, or for the rich in Los Angeles to succeed if the poor in Los Angeles fail, or for Europe to succeed if Africa fails, or for the global economy to succeed if the global environment fails.</div></li></ul><li><div>Don’t Erode the Goal of Goodness</div></li><ul><li><div>The most damaging example of the systems archetype called “drift to low performance” is the process by which modern industrial culture has eroded the goal of morality.</div></li><li><div>Examples of bad human behavior are held up, magnified by the media, affirmed by the culture, as typical. This is just what you would expect. After all, we’re only human. The far more numerous examples of human goodness are barely noticed. They are “not news.” They are exceptions. Must have been a saint. Can’t expect everyone to behave like that. And so expectations are lowered. The gap between desired behavior and actual behavior narrows. Fewer actions are taken to affirm and instill ideals. The public discourse is full of cynicism. Public leaders are visibly, unrepentantly amoral or immoral and are not held to account. Idealism is ridiculed. Statements of moral belief are suspect. It is much easier to talk about hate in public than to talk about love.</div></li><li><div>We know what to do about drift to low performance. Don’t weigh the bad news more heavily than the good. And keep standards absolute.</div></li><li><div>Systems thinking can only tell us to do that. It can’t do it. We’re back to the gap between understanding and implementation. Systems thinking by itself cannot bridge that gap, but it can lead us to the edge of what analysis can do and then point beyond—to what can and must be done by the human spirit</div></li></ul></ul>

          <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
          </ul>
            <div><br></div><div>Key takeaways:</div><ul><li><div>BEGINNINGS: 1970-78</div></li><ul><li><div>Supposedly Irrelevant Factors</div></li><ul><li><div>The existence of formal models based on this misconception of human behavior is what gives economics its reputation as the most powerful of the social sciences—powerful in two distinct ways.</div></li><li><div>The first way is indisputable: of all the social scientists, economists carry the most sway when it comes to influencing public policy.</div></li><li><div>The other way is that economics is also considered the most powerful of the social sciences in an intellectual sense. That power derives from the fact that economics has a unified, core theory from which nearly everything else follows. If you say the phrase “economic theory,” people know what you mean. No other social science has a similar foundation.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The core premise of economic theory is that people choose by optimizing.</span> Of all the goods and services a family could buy, the family chooses the best one that it can afford. Furthermore, the beliefs upon which Econs make choices are assumed to be unbiased. That is, we choose on the basis of what economists call “rational expectations.”</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">This premise of constrained optimization, that is, choosing the best from a limited budget, is combined with the other major workhorse of economic theory, that of equilibrium. In competitive markets where prices are free to move up and down, those prices fluctuate in such a way that supply equals demand. To simplify somewhat, we can say that Optimization + Equilibrium = Economics.</span></div></li><li><div>There is, however, a problem: the premises on which economic theory rests are flawed.</div></li><ul><li><div>First, the optimization problems that ordinary people confront are often too hard for them to solve, or even come close to solving.</div></li><li><div>Second, the beliefs upon which people make their choices are not unbiased.</div></li><li><div>Third, there are many factors that the optimization model leaves out, as my story about the 137-point exam illustrates. In a world of Econs, there is a long list of things that are supposedly irrelevant.</div></li></ul><li><div>Much of what economists do is to collect and analyze data about how markets work, work that is largely done with great care and statistical expertise, and importantly, most of this research does not depend on the assumption that people optimize</div></li></ul><li><div>The Endowment Effect</div></li><ul><li><div>Let a six-year-old girl with brown hair need thousands of dollars for an operation that will prolong her life until Christmas, and the post office will be swamped with nickels and dimes to save her. But let it be reported that without sales tax the hospital facilities of Massachusetts will deteriorate and cause a barely perceptible increase in preventable deaths—not many will drop a tear or reach for their checkbooks.</div></li><li><div>The hospitals stand in for the concept Schelling calls a “statistical life,” as opposed to the girl, who represents an “identified life.”</div></li><li><div>As Schelling notes, we rarely allow any identified life to be extinguished solely for the lack of money. But of course thousands of “unidentified” people die every day for lack of simple things like mosquito nets, vaccines, or clean water.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The opportunity cost of some activity is what you give up by doing it.</span></div></li><li><div>Even economists have trouble equating opportunity costs with out-of-pocket costs. Giving up the opportunity to sell something does not hurt as much as taking the money out of your wallet to pay for it. Opportunity costs are vague and abstract when compared to handing over actual cash.</div></li><li><div>If a store did charge different prices to cash and credit card customers, the “regular price” would be the higher credit card price, with cash customers offered a “discount.” The alternative would have set the cash price as the regular price with credit card customers required to pay a “surcharge.”</div></li><li><div>To an Econ these two policies are identical. If the credit card price is $1.03 and the cash price is $1, it should not matter whether you call the three-cent difference a discount or a surcharge. Nevertheless, the credit card industry rightly had a strong preference for the discount.</div></li><li><div>Many years later Kahneman and Tversky would call this distinction “framing,” but marketers already had a gut instinct that framing mattered. Paying a surcharge is out-of-pocket, whereas not receiving a discount is a “mere” opportunity cost.</div></li><li><div>I called this phenomenon the “endowment effect” because, in economists’ lingo, the stuff you own is part of your endowment, and I had stumbled upon a finding that suggested people valued things that were already part of their endowment more highly than things that could be part of their endowment, that were available but not yet owned.</div></li></ul><li><div>The List</div></li><ul><li><div>What else do people do that is inconsistent with the economists’ model of rational choice?</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“Hindsight bias.” The finding is that, after the fact, we think that we always knew the outcome was likely, if not a foregone conclusion.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Humans have limited time and brainpower. As a result, they use simple rules of thumb—heuristics—to help them make judgments.</span></div></li><li><div>In guessing how frequent something is, we tend to ask ourselves how often we can think of instances of that type.</div></li><li><div>But the rule will fail in cases in which the number of instances of some event is not highly correlated with the ease with which you can summon up examples</div></li><li><div>In saying that people have bounded rationality, Simon meant that they lack the cognitive ability to solve complex problems, which is obviously true.</div></li></ul><li><div>Value Theory</div></li><ul><li><div>The organizing principle was the existence of two different kinds of theories: normative and descriptive.</div></li><li><div>Normative theories tell you the right way to think about some problem. By “right” I do not mean right in some moral sense; instead, I mean logically consistent, as prescribed by the optimizing model at the heart of economic reasoning, sometimes called rational choice theory.</div></li><li><div>Economic theory at that time, and for most economists today, uses one theory to serve both normative and descriptive purposes.</div></li><li><div>Theory of human capital formation, pioneered by the economist Gary Becker, assumes that people choose which kind of education to obtain, and how much time and money to invest in acquiring these skills, by correctly forecasting how much money they will make (and how much fun they will have) in their subsequent careers. There are very few high school and college students whose choices reflect careful analysis of these factors. Instead, many people study the subject they enjoy most without thinking through to what kind of life that will create.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">People’s happiness—or utility, as economists like to call it—increases as they get wealthier, but at a decreasing rate. This principle is called diminishing sensitivity.</span> As wealth grows, the impact of a given increment of wealth, say $100,000, falls. To a peasant, a $100,000 windfall would be life-changing. To Bill Gates, it would go undetected.</div></li><li><div>The first thing I took from my early glimpse of prospect theory was a mission statement: Build descriptive economic models that accurately portray human behavior.</div></li><li><div>The other major takeaway for me was a figure depicting the “value function.” This too was a major conceptual change in economic thinking, and the real engine of the new theory.</div></li><li><div>Kahneman and Tversky focus on changes because changes are the way Humans experience life.</div></li><li><div>Consider Jane, who makes $80,000 per year. She gets a $5,000 year-end bonus that she had not expected. How does Jane process this event? Does she calculate the change in her lifetime wealth, which is barely noticeable? No, she is more likely to think, “Wow, an extra $5,000!” People think about life in terms of changes, not levels. They can be changes from the status quo or changes from what was expected, but whatever form they take, it is changes that make us happy or miserable.</div></li><li><div>The fact that we experience diminishing sensitivity to changes away from the status quo captures another basic human trait—one of the earliest findings in psychology—known as the Weber-Fechner Law.<span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;"> The Weber-Fechner Law holds that the just-noticeable difference in any variable is proportional to the magnitude of that variable. If I gain one ounce, I don’t notice it, but if I am buying fresh herbs, the difference between 2 ounces and 3 ounces is obvious.</span> Psychologists refer to a just noticeable difference as a JND.</div></li><li><div>The fact that people have diminishing sensitivity to both gains and losses has another implication. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">People will be risk-averse for gains, but risk-seeking for losses</span></div></li><li><div>Notice that the loss function is steeper than the gain function: it decreases more quickly than the gain function goes up. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Roughly speaking, losses hurt about twice as much as gains make you feel good</span>.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The fact that a loss hurts more than an equivalent gain gives pleasure is called loss aversion.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>California Dreamin’</div></li><ul><li><div>A slow hunch is not one of those “aha” insights when everything becomes clear. Instead, it is more of a vague impression that there is something interesting going on, and an intuition that there could be something important lurking not far away. The problem with a slow hunch is you have no way to know whether it will lead to a dead end.</div></li></ul><li><div>The Gauntlet</div></li><ul><li><div>As if</div></li><ul><li><div>Briefly stated, the argument is that even if people are not capable of actually solving the complex problems that economists assume they can handle, they behave “as if” they can.</div></li><li><div>Theory of the firm, which comes down to saying that firms maximize profits (or share price).</div></li><li><div>Excellent predictions would be yielded by the hypothesis that the billiard player made his shots as if he knew the complicated mathematical formulas that would give the optimum direction of travel, could estimate by eye the angles etc., describing the location of the balls, could make lightning calculations from the formulas, and could then make the balls travel in the direction indicated by the formulas. Our confidence in this hypothesis is not based on the belief that billiard players, even expert ones, can or do go through the process described; it derives rather from the belief that, unless in some way or other they were capable of reaching essentially the same result, they would not in fact be expert billiard players.</div></li><li><div>Economics is supposed to be a theory of everyone, not only experts. An expert billiard player might play as if he knows all the relevant geometry and physics, but the typical bar player usually aims at the ball closest to a pocket and shoots, often missing. If we are going to have useful theories about how typical people shop, save for retirement, search for a job, or cook dinner, those theories had better not assume that people behave as if they were experts. We don’t play chess like a grandmaster, invest like Warren Buffett, or cook like an Iron Chef. Not even “as if.”</div></li></ul><li><div>Incentives</div></li><ul><li><div>Economists put great stock in incentives. If the stakes are raised, the argument goes, people will have greater incentive to think harder, ask for help, or do what is necessary to get the problem right.</div></li><li><div>Lichtenstein and Slovic had discovered “preference reversals,” a phenomenon that proved disconcerting to economists. In brief, subjects were induced to say that they preferred choice A to choice B . . . and also that they preferred B to A.</div></li><li><div>This finding upset a theoretical foundation essential to any formal economic theory, namely that people have what are called “well-defined preferences,” which simply means that we consistently know what we like.</div></li></ul><li><div>Learning</div></li><ul><li><div>Psychologists tell us that in order to learn from experience, two ingredients are necessary: frequent practice and immediate feedback. When these conditions are present, such as when we learn to ride a bike or drive a car, we learn, possibly with some mishaps along the way. But many of life’s problems do not offer these opportunities, which raises an interesting point. The learning and incentives arguments are, to some extent, contradictory.</div></li><li><div>I wrote a list of products on the blackboard that varied from left to right based on frequency of purchase. On the left I started with cafeteria lunch (daily), then milk and bread (twice a week), and so forth up to sweaters, cars, and homes, career choices, and spouses (not more than two or three per lifetime for most of us). Notice the trend. We do small stuff often enough to learn to get it right, but when it comes to choosing a home, a mortgage, or a job, we don’t get much practice or opportunities to learn. And when it comes to saving for retirement, barring reincarnation we do that exactly once. So Binmore had it backward. Because learning takes practice, we are more likely to get things right at small stakes than at large stakes. This means critics have to decide which argument they want to apply. If learning is crucial, then as the stakes go up, decision-making quality is likely to go down.</div></li></ul><li><div>Markets: the invisible handwave</div></li><ul><li><div>The vague argument is that markets somehow discipline people who are misbehaving. Handwaving is a must because there is no logical way to arrive at a conclusion that markets transform people into rational agents.</div></li><li><div>As cruel as the market may be, it cannot make you rational. And except in rare circumstances, failing to act in accordance with the rational agent model is not fatal.</div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div>MENTAL ACCOUNTING: 1979–85</div></li><ul><li><div>Bargains and Rip-Offs</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">All economic decisions are made through the lens of opportunity costs.</span> The cost of dinner and a movie tonight is not fully captured by the financial outlay—it also depends on the alternative uses of that time and money.</div></li><li><div>If you understand opportunity costs and you have a ticket to a game that you could sell for $1,000, it does not matter how much you paid for the ticket. The cost of going to the game is what you could do with that $1,000. You should only go to the game if that is the best possible way you could use that money.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Acquisition utility is based on standard economic theory and is equivalent to what economists call “consumer surplus.” As the name suggests, it is the surplus remaining after we measure the utility of the object gained and then subtract the opportunity cost of what has to be given up.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Humans, on the other hand, also weigh another aspect of the purchase: the perceived quality of the deal. That is what transaction utility captures.</span> It is defined as the difference between the price actually paid for the object and the price one would normally expect to pay, the reference price.</div></li><li><div>People are willing to pay more for the beer if it was purchased from the resort than from the convenience store. The median† answers, adjusted for inflation, were $7.25 and $4.10.</div></li><li><div>These results show that people are willing to pay different prices for the same beer, consumed at the same spot on the beach, depending on where it was bought. Why do the respondents care where the beer was bought? One reason is expectations. People expect prices to be higher at a fancy hotel, in part because the costs are quite obviously higher. Paying seven dollars for a beer at a resort is annoying but expected; paying that at a bodega is an outrage! This is the essence of transaction utility.</div></li><li><div>Since <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">transaction utility can be either positive or negative</span>—that is, there can be both great deals and awful gouges—it can both prevent purchases that are welfare-enhancing and induce purchases that are a waste of money.</div></li><li><div>For those who are at least living comfortably, negative transaction utility can prevent our consuming special experiences that will provide a lifetime of happy memories, and the amount by which the item was overpriced will long be forgotten. Good deals, on the other hand, can lure all of us into making purchases of objects of little value.</div></li><li><div>Because consumers think this way, sellers have an incentive to manipulate the perceived reference price and create the illusion of a “deal.”</div></li><li><div>In America, some products always seem to be on sale, such as rugs and mattresses, and at some retailers, men’s suits. Goods that are marketed this way share two characteristics: they are bought infrequently and quality is difficult to assess. The infrequent purchases help because consumers often do not notice that there is always a sale going on. Most of us are pleasantly surprised that when we wander in to buy a new mattress, there happens to be a sale this week. And when the quality of a product, like a mattress, is hard to assess, the suggested retail price can do double duty. It can simultaneously suggest that quality is high (thus increasing perceived acquisition utility) and imply that there is transaction utility to be had because the product is “on sale.”</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Several retailers have tried over the years to entice customers with something called “everyday low pricing,” but these experiments usually fail. Getting a great deal is more fun than saving a small and largely invisible amount on each item.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Sunk Costs</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">When an amount of money has been spent and the money cannot be retrieved, the money is said to be sunk, meaning gone.</span></div></li><li><div>Gourville and Soman found that attendance at the club jumps the month after the bill arrives, then tails off over time until the next bill arrives. They called this phenomenon “payment depreciation,” meaning that the effects of sunk costs wear off over time.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Sunk costs matter, at least for a while, but may be forgotten eventually.</span></div></li><li><div>In order to shop at Costco a customer must become a “member,” which currently costs a household $55 a year. It seems likely that members view the annual fee as an “investment” and make no attempt to allocate that cost over the various purchases they make during the year. Rather, it serves as a sunk cost, offering up yet another reason to shop at Costco.</div></li><li><div>Amazon charges customers $99 a year to become a “prime member” which entitles them to “free” shipping. Again, the cost of the membership may well be viewed as an investment that does not “count” toward the cost of a particular purchase.</div></li><li><div>Buckets and Budgets</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The existence of budgets can violate another first principle of economics: money is fungible, meaning that it has no labels restricting what it can be spent on.</span> Like most economic principles, this has strong logic behind it. If there is money left over in the utilities budget because of a mild winter, it will spend perfectly well at the children’s shoe store.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Money in a checking account is slightly more out of reach than cash, but if there is money in an account labeled “savings,” people are more reluctant to draw that money down.</span> This can lead to the odd behavior of simultaneously borrowing at a high rate of interest and saving at a low rate, for example by keeping money in a savings account earning virtually no interest while maintaining an outstanding balance on a credit card that charges interest at more than 20% per year.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The most sacred accounts are long-term savings accounts, generally those dedicated for future spending, such as retirement accounts or children’s education accounts.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>At the Poker Table</div></li><ul><li><div>If you ask people whether they would rather lose $100 for sure or choose a gamble in which they have a 50% chance of losing $200 and a 50% chance of breaking even, a majority will choose the gamble. These results are the opposite of those found when the choice is between a guaranteed gain of $100 and a 50-50 gamble for $0 or $200, where people prefer the sure thing.</div></li><li><div>Suppose I am down $100 at the racetrack and I would like to get back to zero to avoid closing this account in the red. Yes, I could bet $2 on a 50-to-1 long shot and have a small chance of breaking even, but I could instead bet another $100 on an even-money favorite and have a 50% chance of breaking even. If I am risk-seeking (meaning that I prefer a gamble to a sure thing that is equal to the expected outcome of the bet) why don’t I make the $100 bet on the favorite and improve my chances of breaking even?</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Players who were behind were attracted to small bets that offered a slim chance for a big win (such as drawing to an inside straight) but disliked big bets that risked a substantial increase to the size of their loss, even though they offered a higher probability of breaking even.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“House money effect.” Although subjects tend to be risk averse for gains, meaning that most of them would normally turn down a coin flip gamble to win or lose $9. When we told them they had just won $30, they were eager to take that gamble.</span></div></li><li><div>Instead of the simple prediction from prospect theory that people will be risk-seeking for losses, in problem 2 a loss of $30 does not generate risk-taking preferences when there is no chance to break even. But when given that chance, in problem 3, a majority of the subjects opt to gamble.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">A good rule to remember is that people who are threatened with big losses and have a chance to break even will be unusually willing to take risks, even if they are normally quite risk averse.</span></div></li></ul></ul><li><div>SELF-CONTROL: 1975–88</div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>This distinction between what we want and what we choose has no meaning in modern economics, in which preferences are literally defined by what we choose. Choices are said to “reveal preferences.”</div></li><li><div>Although it is never stated explicitly as an assumption in an economics textbook, in practice economic theory presumes that self-control problems do not exist.</div></li><li><div>Willpower? No Problem</div></li><ul><li><div>The crucial feature of Smith’s conception of our passions is that they are myopic, that is, shortsighted. As he framed it, the problem is that <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“The pleasure which we are to enjoy ten years hence, interests us so little in comparison with that which we may enjoy to-day.”</span></div></li><li><div>William Stanley Jevons, another economics luminary, refined Smith’s observation about myopia, noting that the <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">preference for present consumption over future consumption diminishes over time</span>. We may care a lot about getting that bowl of ice cream right now rather than tomorrow, but we would scarcely care about a choice between this date next year versus the day before or after.</div></li><li><div>Irving Fisher provided the first economic treatment of intertemporal choice that might be considered “modern.” In his 1930 classic, <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The Theory of Interest</span>, he used what have become the basic teaching tools of microeconomics—indifference curves—to show how an individual will choose between consumption at two different points of time, given a market rate of interest. His theory qualifies as modern both in its tools and in the sense that it is normative. He explains what a rational person should do.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Discounted utility model: The basic idea is that consumption is worth more to you now than later.</span></div></li><li><div>If given the choice between a great dinner this week or one a year from now, most of us would prefer the dinner sooner rather than later. Using the Samuelson formulation, we are said to “discount” future consumption at some rate. If a dinner a year from now is only considered to be 90% as good as one right now, we are said to be discounting the future dinner at an annual rate of about 10%.</div></li><li><div>Samuelson correctly notes that if people discount the future at rates that vary over time, then people may not behave consistently, that is, they may change their minds as time moves forward. The specific case he worries about is the same one that worried earlier economists such as Jevons and Pigou, namely, the case where we are most impatient for immediate rewards.</div></li><li><div>Intertemporal choice is not just an abstract concept used in theoretical economics. It plays a vital role in macroeconomics, where it underlies what is called the consumption function, which tells us how the spending of a household varies with its income.</div></li><li><div>The consumption function tells us how much of the money will be spent and how much will be saved. Economic thinking about the consumption function changed quite dramatically between the mid-1930s and the mid-1950s. The way in which models of the consumption function evolved illustrates an interesting feature about how economic theory has developed since the Samuelson revolution began. As economists became more mathematically sophisticated, and their models incorporated those new levels of sophistication, the people they were describing evolved as well. First, Econs became smarter. Second, they cured all their self-control problems.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Modigliani’s life-cycle hypothesis, in which people decide how much of their lifetime wealth to consume each period, does not just assume that people are smart enough to make all the necessary calculations (with rational expectations) about how much they will make, how long they will live, and so forth, but also that they have enough self-control to implement the resulting optimal plan.</span> There is an additional unstated assumption: namely, that wealth is fungible. In the model, it does not matter whether the wealth is held in cash, home equity, a retirement plan, or an heirloom painting passed on from a prior generation. Wealth is wealth. We know from the previous chapters on mental accounting that this assumption is no more innocuous or accurate than the assumptions about cognitive abilities and willpower.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Behavioral life-cycle hypothesis: We assume that a household’s consumption in a given year will not depend just on its lifetime wealth, but also on the mental accounts in which that wealth is held. The marginal propensity to consume from winning $1,000 in a lottery is likely to be much higher than a similar increase in the value of a household’s retirement holdings.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">A team of behavioral economists showed that when investors in retirement plans earn high returns, making them richer, they increase their saving rates, most likely because they extrapolate this investment success into the future.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>The Planner and the Doer</div></li><ul><li><div>This story illustrates two important tools that people use to confront self-control problems.</div></li><li><div>For the crew, the strategy was to remove the cues that would tempt them to do something stupid. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Out of sight, out of mind. </span></div></li><li><div>For himself, Odysseus chose a <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">commitment strategy: he limited his own choices to prevent self-destruction.</span></div></li><li><div>The amount of time a kid waited in one of those experiments turned out to be a valid predictor of many important life outcomes, from SAT scores to career success to drug use.</div></li><li><div>Ainslie’s paper also provides a long discussion of various strategies for dealing with self-control problems. One course of action is commitment: removing the cashews or tying yourself to the mast. Another is to raise the cost of submitting to temptation. For example, if you want to quit smoking, you could write a large check to someone you see often with permission to cash the check if you are seen smoking. Or you can make that bet with yourself, what Ainslie calls a “private side bet.” You could say to yourself, “I won’t watch the game on television tonight until I finish [some task you are tempted to postpone].”</div></li><li><div>If I know I am going to change my mind about my preferences (I will not limit myself to a few more cashew nuts, as I intend, rather I will eat the entire bowl), when and why would I take some action to restrict my future choices?</div></li><li><div>We all have occasions on which we change our minds, but usually we do not go to extraordinary steps to prevent ourselves from deviating from the original plan. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The only circumstances in which you would want to commit yourself to your planned course of action is when you have good reason to believe that if you change your preferences later, this change of preferences will be a mistake.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">We propose that at any point in time an individual consists of two selves. There is a forward-looking “planner” who has good intentions and cares about the future, and a devil-may-care “doer” who lives for the present.</span></div></li><li><div>In a principal–agent model the principal is the boss, often the owner of a firm, and the agent is someone to whom authority is delegated. In the context of an organization, tensions arise because the agent knows some things that the principal does not, and it is too costly for the principal to monitor every action that the agent takes.</div></li><li><div>In our intrapersonal framework, the agents are a series of short-lived doers; specifically, we assume there is a new doer each time period, say each day. The doer wants to enjoy himself and is completely selfish in that that he does not care at all about any future doers. The planner, in contrast, is completely altruistic. All she cares about is the utility of the series of doers.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The planner has two sets of tools she can use to influence the actions of the doers. She can either try to influence the decisions that the doers make through rewards or penalties (financial or otherwise) that still allow them discretion, or she can impose rules, such as commitment strategies, which limit the doers’ options.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">If there are no commitment strategies available, the only other tool the planner has in our model is guilt.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The thing to notice about this figure is that when guilt is employed, life is less pleasurable.</span></div></li><li><div>Another way to think about this is that <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">employing willpower requires effort.</span></div></li><li><div>This analysis suggests that if one can implement perfect rules, life will be better. The strategy of using programmable safes, each containing one energy bar, achieves much more satisfaction than the guilt-induced diet.</div></li><li><div>Why not always use rules? One reason is that externally enforced rules may not be easily available. Even if you arrange to get a healthy dinner delivered to your home each night, ready to eat, there will be nothing stopping you from also ordering a pizza. Also, even if such rules are available, they are inflexible by design.</div></li><li><div>Of course, there are other techniques of control, used by both organizations and individuals, which involve keeping track of expenditures. In organizations, these techniques are called accounting.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Humans use mental accounting, with the help of envelopes, mason jars, and retirement savings plans, to accomplish the same purpose. Notice that the failure to treat various pots of money as fungible, as Econs would do, is what makes such accounting strategies feasible.</span></div></li><li><div>Most of us realize that we have self-control problems, but we underestimate their severity. We are naïve about our level of sophistication. In particular, we suffer from what George Loewenstein has called “hot-cold empathy gaps.” When we are in a cool, reflective mood—say, contemplating what to eat at dinner on Wednesday after just having finished a satisfying brunch on Sunday—we think we will have no trouble sticking to our plan to eat healthy, low-calorie dinners during the week. But when Wednesday night comes along and friends suggest going out to a new pizza place featuring craft beers, we end up eating and drinking more than we would have predicted on Sunday, or even on Wednesday before arriving at the restaurant with its tempting aromas wafting from the wood-burning oven, not to mention an intriguing list of special brews to sample. For such cases we may need a planner to have established a rule—no midweek beer and pizza outings—and then to think of a way of enforcing that rule.</div></li></ul><li><div>Misbehaving in the Real World</div></li><ul><li><div>The first problem to solve was how to raise the ticket price without losing too many customers.</div></li><li><div>To partially justify the higher prices we tried to improve the skier experience, to make the purchase seem less of a rip-off.* I remember one early idea I had along these lines. There was a short racecourse on the side of one of the trails, where a skier could run through a series of slalom gates and receive an official time that was broadcast over loudspeakers. Younger skiers enjoyed the competitive aspect of this, and the gates were close enough together that speeds were safe. The price charged to use the racecourse was one dollar. A dollar was not a lot to pay, but the fee was a damn nuisance.</div></li><li><div>Why not make this free, I asked? We can improve the skier experience at a trivial cost. This was a no-brainer.</div></li><li><div>The goal was to offer the locals a deal that would not be available to the out-of-town skiers who drove in once or twice a year. To these skiers, the price of the lift ticket was only a small portion of the trip’s expense, which included transportation, food, and lodging. A few dollars more for the lift ticket was unlikely to sway the decision about whether to make the trip, especially given the lack of nearby competition. We ended up with a solution called the ten-pack. It included five weekend tickets and five weekday tickets and was sold at 40% off the retail price when purchased by October 15.</div></li><li><div>Ten-packs turned out to be wildly popular with the locals. There are a few behavioral factors that explain their popularity. The first is obvious: 40% off sounds like a great deal. Lots of transaction utility. Second, the advance purchase decoupled the purchase decision from the decision to go skiing. As with wine mental accounting, the initial purchase could be viewed as an “investment” that saves money, making a spur-of-the-moment decision to go skiing on a sunny Friday after a recent snowfall costless to implement. That the customer may have gone out for a nice dinner the previous weekend would not put the recreation mental account in the red; the skiing was “free.” And from the resort’s point of view, it was better than free—it was a sunk cost.† As the season progressed, skiers would be eager to use some of their tickets to avoid wasting the money invested in the ten-pack, and they might bring along a friend who would pay full price.</div></li><li><div>Avid skiers who had been waiting since the previous March would show up for the first runs of a new season. What price should they be charged? Al’s policy had been to look out his window at the mountain and the weather, and then tell the ticket sellers the price, often half off the regular price. Of course, most of the skiers who arrived had no idea what the price would be; they only knew the retail price. Only true diehards might have been able to unravel Al’s pricing strategy for the early season. I call this a “secret sale.” A customer comes up to the cash register prepared to pay retail and the seller says, “Oh, that item is on sale for 50% off.” It might generate goodwill, but it is not a brilliant pricing strategy, because the customer was ready to pay the full price. Reducing the price only makes sense if it increases current sales or perhaps future sales by building customer loyalty.</div></li><li><div>Michael and I came up with a new strategy. Early in the season, or for that matter, any time only part of the mountain was open for skiing, pricing followed a set formula. Skiers would pay full price to ski that day, but would get a coupon good for up to 50% off their next visit, depending on how many chair lifts were operating. Since customers were expecting to pay full price, this offer seemed generous, and the coupon might induce them to come back, and perhaps buy lunch and a beer as well.</div></li><li><div>A rebate seems to be just another name for a temporary sale, but they seemed to be more popular than an equivalent reduction in price, as one might expect based on mental accounting. Suppose the list price of the car was $14,800. Reducing the price to $14,500 did not seem like a big deal, not a just-noticeable difference. But by calling the price reduction a rebate, the consumer was encouraged to think about the $300 separately, which would intensify its importance.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div>WORKING WITH DANNY: 1984–85</div></li><ul><li><div>What Seems Fair?</div></li><ul><li><div>What makes an economic transaction seem “fair”?

Is it that the doll will go to someone affluent enough to win the auction, or is it that the store owner has opted to extract every possible penny from a desperate parent with a toddler waiting anxiously for Christmas Eve?</div></li><li><div>To find out, we asked the same question to another group of respondents but added one extra sentence stating that the proceeds will be donated to UNICEF. That yielded an acceptable rating of 79%. Auctioning a doll is fine if the proceeds go to charity, unless the “charity” is the owner’s wallet.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">In many situations, the perceived fairness of an action depends not only on who it helps or harms, but also on how it is framed.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Any firm should establish the highest price it intends to charge as the “regular” price, with any deviations from that price called “sales” or “discounts.” Removing a discount is not nearly as objectionable as adding a surcharge.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Perceptions of fairness are related to the endowment effect. Both buyers and sellers feel entitled to the terms of trade to which they have become accustomed, and treat any deterioration of those terms as a loss. This feeling of ownership of the usual conditions of sale is particularly true when a seller starts to charge for something that has traditionally been given away for free or included in the price. In this way, the status quo becomes a reference point.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Wages and salaries appear to be sticky. </span>When a recession hits, either wages do not fall at all or they fall too little to keep everyone employed. Why?</div></li><li><div>One partial explanation for this fact is that cutting wages makes workers so angry that firms find it better to keep pay levels fixed and just lay off surplus employees</div></li><li><div>The value of seeming fair should be especially high for firms that plan to be in business selling to the same customers for a long time, since those firms have more to lose from seeming to act unfairly.</div></li><li><div>My takeaway from these examples is that temporary spikes in demand, from blizzards to rock star deaths, are an especially bad time for any business to appear greedy.</div></li><li><div>“It is incredibly important for any business, no matter how great the demand, not to charge a customer more than the good or service is worth—even if the customer is willing to pay more.”</div></li></ul><li><div>Fairness Games</div></li><ul><li><div>Would people be willing to punish a firm that behaves unfairly?</div></li><li><div>Somewhat surprisingly to us (or at least to me), the students in the Dictator stage of our game were remarkably nice. Nearly three quarters (74%) chose to divide the money equally. Of more interest to us, the results of the Punishment stage were even stronger. Fully 81% of the subjects chose to share $10 with a “fair” allocator rather than $12 with an “unfair” allocator.</div></li><li><div>There is clear evidence that people dislike unfair offers and are willing to take a financial hit to punish those who make them. It is less clear that people feel morally obliged to make fair offers. Although it is true that in the Ultimatum Game the most common offer is often 50%, one cannot conclude that Proposers are trying to be fair. Instead, they may be quite rationally worried about being rejected. Given the empirical evidence on respondents’ behavior, the profit-maximizing strategy in the Ultimatum Game is for the Proposer to offer about 40% of the pie. Lower offers start to run the risk of being rejected, so a 50% offer is not far from the rational selfish strategy.</div></li><li><div>Proposers make offers of close to half the pie, and Responders tend to reject offers of less than 20%.</div></li><li><div>In the more general version of this game without the prisoner cover story, there are two strategies, cooperate (stay silent) or defect (confess). The game theoretic prediction is that both players will defect because, no matter what the other player does, it is in the selfish best interest of each player to do so. Yet when this game is played in the laboratory, 40–50% of the players cooperate, which means that about half the players either do not understand the logic of the game or feel that cooperating is the just the right thing to do, or possibly both.</div></li><li><div>Suppose we invite ten strangers to the lab and give each of them five one-dollar bills. Each subject can decide how many (if any) dollar bills he wishes to contribute to the “public good” by privately putting that money into a blank envelope. The rules of the game are that the total contributions to the public good envelope are doubled, and then the money is divided equally among all the players.</div></li><li><div>The rational, selfish strategy in the Public Goods Game is to contribute nothing. Suppose that Brendan decides to contribute one dollar. That dollar is doubled by the experimenter to two dollars and then is divided among all the players, making Brendan’s share of that contribution 20 cents. So for each dollar he contributes, Brendan will lose 80 cents.</div></li><li><div>Notice that by being selfishly rational in this way, the group ends up with half as much money as they would have had if everyone contributed their entire stake, because if everyone contributed $5, that amount would be doubled, and everyone would go home with $10.</div></li><li><div>A robust finding in public goods experiments is that if a group of subjects play the game repeatedly, cooperation rates steadily fall, from the usual 50% down to nearly zero.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Repeated play of the Public Goods Game does not teach people to be jerks; rather it teaches them that they are playing with (some) jerks, and no one likes to play the role of the sucker.</span></div></li><li><div>A large proportion of people can be categorized as conditional cooperators, meaning that they are willing to cooperate if enough others do.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Cooperation can be maintained even in repeated games if players are given the opportunity to punish those who do not cooperate.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Not everyone will free ride all the time, but some people are ready to pick your pocket if you are not careful.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Mugs</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">People are more likely to keep what they start with than to trade it</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Those who start out with some object will tend to keep it, while those who don’t have such an object won’t be that keen to buy one.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The endowment effect experiments show that people have a tendency to stick with what they have, at least in part because of loss aversion. </span>Once I have that mug, I think of it as mine. Giving it up would be a loss. And the endowment effect can kick in very fast. In our experiments, the subjects had “owned” that mug for a few minutes before the trading started. Danny liked to call this the “instant endowment effect.”</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">In physics, an object in a state of rest stays that way, unless something happens. People act the same way: they stick with what they have unless there is some good reason to switch, or perhaps despite there being a good reason to switch. Economists William Samuelson and Richard Zeckhauser have dubbed this behavior “status quo bias.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Loss aversion and status quo bias will often work together as forces that inhibit change.</span></div></li></ul></ul><li><div>ENGAGING WITH THE ECONOMICS PROFESSION: 1986–94<br></div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>The Debate Begins</div></li><ul><li><div>Rationality (meaning optimization) is neither necessary nor sufficient to do good economic theory.</div></li><li><div>Arrow noted that there could be many rigorous, formal theories based on behavior that economists would not be willing to call rational. As an example, he noted that the standard theory of the consumer states that when prices change, the consumer will solve the new optimization problem and choose a new “best” set of goods and services that still satisfies the budget constraint. Yet, he noted, one could easily build a theory based on habits. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">When prices change, the consumer chooses the affordable bundle that is closest to what she was consuming before.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">So-called “irrelevance theorem,” which proved that, under certain assumptions, it would not matter whether a firm chose to pay a dividend or instead use that money to repurchase their own shares or reduce their debts. The idea is that investors should care neither where money is stashed nor how it is paid out.</span></div></li><li><div>One of the key assumptions in the Miller–Modigliani irrelevance theorem was the absence of taxes.</div></li><li><div>The way taxes come into play is that income, including dividend income, was then taxed at rates as high as 50% or more, whereas capital gains were taxed at a rate of 25%. Furthermore, this latter tax was only paid when the capital gain was realized, that is, when the stock was sold. The effect of these tax rules was that shareholders would much rather get capital gains than dividends, at least if the shareholders were Econs. Importantly, a firm could easily transform a dividend into a capital gain by using the funds that would go to paying dividends to repurchase shares in the firm. Instead of receiving a dividend, shareholders would see the price of their shares go up, and would save money on their tax bill. So the puzzle was: why did firms punish their tax-paying shareholders by paying dividends?</div></li><li><div>Shefrin and Statman’s answer relied on a combination of self-control and mental accounting. The notion was that some shareholders—retirees, for instance—like the idea of getting inflows that are mentally categorized as “income” so that they don’t feel bad spending that money to live on.</div></li><li><div>Firms only increase dividends when they are confident that earnings have gone up enough such that dividends will not have to be cut in the future.</div></li></ul><li><div>Anomalies</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Paradigms change only once experts believe there are a large number of anomalies that are not explained by the current paradigm. A few scattered unexplained facts are not enough to upend the conventional wisdom.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">A paradigm shift is one of the rare cataclysmic events in science when people make a substantial break with the way the field has been progressing and pursue a new direction.</span></div></li><li><div>First, people have a natural tendency to search for confirming rather than disconfirming evidence, as shown by the relative popularity of the 2 over the 3. This tendency is called the confirmation bias.</div></li><li><div>Second, the confirmation bias can be accentuated when unwarranted assumptions make some kinds of disconfirming evidence seem unlikely, as illustrated by the unpopularity of turning over the B.</div></li><li><div>An economic anomaly is a result inconsistent with the present economics paradigm. Economics is distinguished from other social sciences by the belief that most (all?) behavior can be explained by assuming that agents have stable, well-defined preferences and make rational choices consistent with those preferences in markets that (eventually) clear. An empirical result is anomalous if it is difficult to “rationalize,” or if implausible assumptions are necessary to explain it within the paradigm.</div></li></ul><li><div>Forming a Team</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">In a laboratory setting, “firms” that elected to pay more than the minimum wage were rewarded with higher effort levels by their “workers.”</span></div></li><li><div>The theory is that if the employer treats the worker well, in terms of pay and working conditions, that gift will be reciprocated with higher effort levels and lower turnover, thus making the payment of above-market wages economically profitable.</div></li><li><div>Explain the apparently contradictory behavior observed in situations like the Ultimatum and Dictator Games. The contradiction is that people appear altruistic in the Dictator Game, giving away money to an anonymous stranger, but also seem to be mean to others who treat them unfairly in the Ultimatum Game. So, does increasing the happiness of someone else make us happier too, or does it make us less happy, perhaps because of envy? The answer, Rabin suggested, hinges on reciprocity. <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">We are nice to people who treat us nicely and mean to people who treat us badly. </span>The finding discussed earlier, that people act as “conditional cooperators,” is consistent with Rabin’s model.</div></li></ul><li><div>Narrow Framing on the Upper East Side</div></li><ul><li><div>The idea is called “<span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">narrow framing</span>,” and it is related to a more general mental accounting question: when are economic events or transactions combined, and when are they treated separately? <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">If you go on a vacation, is each component of the cost of the trip (travel, hotel, meals, outings, gifts) considered a separate transaction, or are they pooled into the vacation category and evaluated together, as they would be in an all-inclusive cruise trip?</span> The specific question that Danny and I were each pondering is: when do people get themselves into trouble by treating events one at a time, rather than as a portfolio?</div></li><li><div>When the expert was thinking about the problem as a member of project team, he was locked in the inside view—caught up in the optimism that comes with group endeavors—and did not bother thinking about what psychologists call “base rates,” that is, the average time for similar projects. When he put on his expert hat, thereby taking the outside view, he naturally thought of all the other projects he’d known and made a more accurate guess. If the outside view is fleshed out carefully and informed with appropriate baseline data, it will be far more reliable than the inside view.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The “timid choices” part of the Kahneman and Lovallo story is based on loss aversion. Each manager is loss averse regarding any outcomes that will be attributed to him. In an organizational setting, the natural feeling of loss aversion can be exacerbated by the system of rewards and punishment. In many companies, creating a large gain will lead to modest rewards, while creating an equal-sized loss will get you fired. Under those terms, even a manager who starts out risk neutral, willing to take any bet that will make money on average, will become highly risk averse.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">In order to get managers to be willing to take risks, it is necessary to create an environment in which those managers will be rewarded for decisions that were value-maximizing ex ante, that is, with information available at the time they were made, even if they turn out to lose money ex post.</span> Implementing such a policy is made difficult by hindsight bias. Whenever there is a time lapse between the times when a decision is made and when the results come in, the boss may have trouble remembering that he originally thought it was a good idea too. The bottom line is that <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">in many situations in which agents are making poor choices, the person who is misbehaving is often the principal, not the agent.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The misbehavior is in failing to create an environment in which employees feel that they can take good risks and not be punished if the risks fail to pay off. I call these situations “dumb principal” problems.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“Myopic loss aversion.” The only way you can ever take 100 attractive bets is by first taking the first one, and it is only thinking about the bet in isolation that fools you into turning it down.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The more often people look at their portfolios, the less willing they will be to take on risk, because if you look more often, you will see more losses.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Looking at the returns on your portfolio more often can make you less willing to take risk.</span></div></li><li><div>On busy days, drivers make more per hour and can expect to make more if they work an additional hour. Having established this, we looked at our central question and got a result economists found shocking. The higher the wage, the less drivers worked.</div></li><li><div>We discovered that if we split each of our samples in half according to how long the subjects had been cab drivers, in every case the more experienced drivers behaved more sensibly. For the most part, they drove more when wages were higher, not lower.</div></li><li><div>Suppose that drivers keep track of their earnings at a monthly rather than a daily level. If they decided to drive the same amount each day, they would earn about 5% more than they do in our sample. And if they drove more on good days and less on bad days, they would earn 10% more over the same amount of hours.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div>FINANCE: 1983–2003<br></div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>The Beauty Contest</div></li><ul><li><div>The EMH has two components, which are somewhat related but are conceptually distinct.† One component is concerned with the rationality of prices; the other concerns whether it is possible to “beat the market.”</div></li><li><div>“The price is riiiight!” Essentially, the idea is that any asset will sell for its true “intrinsic value.” If the rational valuation of a company is $100 million, then its stock will trade such that the market cap of the firm is $100 million. This principle is thought to hold both for individual securities and for the overall market.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“No free lunch” principle—the idea that there is no way to beat the market.&nbsp;</span>Because all publicly available information is reflected in current stock prices, it is impossible to reliably predict future prices and make a profit.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">It is risky to be a contrarian. “Worldly wisdom teaches that is it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.”</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Does the Stock Market Overreact?</div></li><ul><li><div>No rational agent will want to buy a stock that some other rational agent is willing to sell. Imagine two financial analysts, Tom and Jerry, are playing a round of golf. Tom mentions that he is thinking of buying 100 shares of Apple. Jerry says, that’s convenient, I was thinking of selling 100 shares. I could sell my shares to you and avoid the commission to my broker. Before they can agree on a deal, both think better of it. Tom realizes that Jerry is a smart guy, so asks himself, why is he selling? Jerry is thinking the same about Tom, so they call off the trade.</div></li><li><div>“Value investing,” in which the goal is to find securities that are priced below their intrinsic, long-run value.</div></li><li><div>Starting in 1937, he took the thirty stocks included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (some of the largest companies in America) and ranked them based on P/E. He then formed two portfolios—one of the ten stocks with the highest P/Es and the other of the ten stocks with the lowest P/Es—and showed that the “cheap” stocks outperformed the expensive group by an impressive margin. Over the period from 1937 to 1969, a $10,000 investment in the cheap stocks would have increased in value to $66,900, while the expensive stock portfolio would only have increased to $25,300. (Buying the entire original thirty-stock portfolio would have produced $44,000.) Implicitly, Graham was offering a kind of behavioral explanation for this finding. Cheap stocks were unpopular or out of favor, while expensive stocks were fashionable. By being a contrarian, Graham argued, you could beat the market, although not all the time.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Value effect, one based on the tendency for people to extrapolate the recent past into the future.</span></div></li><li><div>Suppose that the “P/E effect” is caused by overreaction: high P/E stocks (known as growth stocks because they are going to have to grow like crazy to justify their high prices) have gone up “too high” because investors have made overly optimistic forecasts of future growth rates, and low P/E stocks, or value stocks, have sunk “too low,” because investors are excessively pessimistic. If true, the subsequent high returns to value stocks and low returns to growth stocks represent simple regression toward the mean.</div></li><li><div>Our study was simple. We would take all the stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (which, at that time, had nearly all of the largest companies) and rank their performance over some time period long enough to allow investors to get overly optimistic or pessimistic about some company, say three to five years. We would call the best performing stocks “Winners” and the worst performers “Losers.” Then we would take a group of the biggest Winners and Losers (say the most extreme thirty-five stocks) and compare their performance going forward. If markets were efficient, we should expect the two portfolios to do equally well. After all, according to the EMH, the past cannot predict the future. But if our overreaction hypothesis were correct, Losers would outperform Winners.</div></li></ul><li><div>The Reaction to Overreaction</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The solution for the market efficiency folks was to fall back on an important technicality: it is not a violation of the efficient market hypothesis if you beat the market by taking on more risk. The difficulty comes in knowing how to measure risk.</span></div></li><li><div>All tests of the no-free-lunch component of market efficiency were actually “joint tests” of two hypotheses: market efficiency and some model of risk and return.</div></li><li><div>At that time, the right and proper way to measure the risk of a stock was to use the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) developed independently by financial economists John Lintner and William Sharpe.</div></li><li><div>According to the CAPM, the only risk that gets rewarded in a rational world is the degree to which a stock’s return is correlated with the rest of the market. If you form a portfolio composed of a bunch of highly risky stocks whose prices bounce around a lot, the portfolio itself will not be especially risky if the price movements of each of the component stocks are independent of one another, because then the movements will on average cancel out. But if the returns on the stocks are positively correlated, meaning they tend to go up and down together, then a portfolio of volatile stocks remains pretty risky; the benefits of diversification conferred by holding a portfolio of the stocks are not as great. In this way, according to the CAPM, the correct measure of the riskiness of a stock is simply its correlation with the rest of the market, a measure that is called “beta.”</div></li><li><div>Both value stocks and the stocks of small companies did indeed earn higher returns than predicted by the CAPM.</div></li><li><div>French Three Factor Model, in which, in addition to the traditional beta, two extra explanatory factors were added to rationalize the anomalous high returns to small companies and value stocks. Fama and French showed that the returns on value stocks are correlated, meaning that a value stock will tend to do well when other value stocks are doing well, and that the same is true for small-cap stocks.</div></li><li><div>Fama and French have announced a new five-factor model. The new factors are one that measures a firm’s profitability (which predicts high returns) and another that captures how aggressively a firm invests (which predicts low returns).</div></li><li><div>Many practitioners would add a sixth factor: momentum. Firms that have done well over the last six to twelve months tend to keep doing well for the next six to twelve months.</div></li></ul><li><div>The Price Is Not Right</div></li><ul><li><div>An important property of rational forecasts—as a stock price is supposed to be—is that the predictions cannot vary more than the thing being forecast.</div></li><li><div>After adjusting for the well-established trend that stock prices go up over long periods of time, Shiller found that the present value of dividends was, like the temperature in Singapore, highly stable. But stock prices, which we should interpret as attempts to forecast the present value of dividends, are highly variable.</div></li><li><div>If prices are too variable, then they are in some sense “wrong.” It is hard to argue that the price at the close of trading on Thursday, October 15, and the price at the close of trading the following Monday—which was more than 25% lower—can both be rational measures of intrinsic value, given the absence of news.</div></li><li><div>The paper, titled “Stock Prices and Social Dynamics,” embraced the heretical idea that <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">social phenomena might influence stock prices just as much as they do fashion trends.</span></div></li><li><div>Notice that when the market diverges from its historical trends, eventually it reverts back to the mean. Stocks looked cheap in the 1970s and eventually recovered, and they looked expensive in the late 1990s and eventually crashed. So there appears to be some predictive power stemming from Shiller’s long-term price/earnings ratio. Which brings us to that “but.” The predictive power is not very precise.</div></li><li><div>When prices diverge strongly from historical levels, in either direction, there is some predictive value in these signals. And the further prices diverge from historic levels, the more seriously the signals should be taken. Investors should be wary of pouring money into markets that are showing signs of being overheated, but also should not expect to be able to get rich by successfully timing the market. It is much easier to detect that we may be in a bubble than it is to say when it will pop, and investors who attempt to make money by timing market turns are rarely successful.</div></li></ul><li><div>The Battle of Closed-End Funds</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The law of one price. The law asserts that in an efficient market, the same asset cannot simultaneously sell for two different prices. If that happened, there would be an immediate arbitrage opportunity, meaning a way to make a series of trades that are guaranteed to generate a profit at no risk.</span></div></li><li><div>The average discount on closed-end funds was correlated with the difference in returns between small and large company stocks; the greater the discount, the larger the difference in returns between those two types of stocks.</div></li><li><div>Fruit Flies, Icebergs, and Negative Stock Prices</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">There is a first principle of finance even more fundamental than the law of one price, which is that a stock price can never be negative.</span></div></li><li><div>Two ingredients are necessary for a violation of the law of one price to emerge and persist. The first is that you need some investors with an inexplicable desire to own a pure, unadulterated version of Palm rather than one watered down with extra money and a share of a profitable company. In other words, you need noise traders, a.k.a. Summers’s IDIOTS.</div></li><li><div>The other thing that is necessary for this to happen is that something must be preventing the “smart money” from driving the prices back to where they are supposed to be.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div>WELCOME TO CHICAGO: 1995–PRESENT</div></li><ul><li><div>Law Schooling</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The real point of behavioral economics is to highlight behaviors that are in conflict with the standard rational model.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Coase theorem. The theorem can be easily stated: in the absence of transaction costs, meaning that people can easily trade with one another, resources will flow to their highest-valued use.</span></div></li><li><div>Suppose Alexa is willing to pay $5 per night to blast her music, and Julia is willing to pay $3 a night for silence. If Julia is awarded the right to silence, then, according to the Coase theorem, Alexa will pay Julia some amount between $3 and $5 for the right to play her music, an amount Julia will accept. Both will be happier this way than if Alexa couldn’t play her music but no money changed hands; that is, after all, why they’re both agreeing to the transaction. And if Alexa wins the right to play her music, Julia will be unwilling to pay her enough to stop, since her value of silence is less than Alexa’s joy of music. Either way, Julia will have to find somewhere else to study if she wants quiet.</div></li><li><div>Judges often decide who owns a certain right, and the Coase theorem says that if transaction costs are low, then what the judge decides won’t actually determine what economic activities will take place; the judge will just decide who has to pay.</div></li><li><div>When we gave every other student a coffee mug, the Coase theorem predicts that the students who liked the mugs most should end up owning them, and since the mugs were randomly assigned, about half the mugs should trade. Yet we found that trading volume was much lower than that: resources were not flowing at the rate predicted. And the reason was the endowment effect: people given mugs valued them about twice as much as people not given the mugs. How goods were allocated did affect who would end up owning the mugs. In other words, the Coase theorem worked in theory, when trading for tokens redeemable for cash, but it did not work in practice, when trading for real-world objects like coffee mugs.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">When people are given what they consider to be unfair offers, they can get angry enough to punish the other party, even at some cost to themselves. That is the basic lesson of the Ultimatum Game.</span> As the willow tree story illustrates, the same can occur in situations in which the Coase theorem is often applied.

[I]t doesn’t matter if 90 percent of people can’t do the complex analysis required to calculate probabilities. The 10 percent of people who can will end up in the jobs where it’s required.”</div></li><li><div>Five findings from the psychology of decision-making supported our hypothesis that early picks will be too expensive:</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">People are overconfident. They are likely to think their ability to discriminate between the ability of two players is greater than it is.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">People make forecasts that are too extreme.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The winner’s curse. When many bidders compete for the same object, the winner of the auction is often the bidder who most overvalues the object being sold.</span> The same will be true for players, especially the highly touted players picked early in the first round. The winner’s curse says that those players will be good, but not as good as the teams picking them think. Most teams thought that Ricky Williams was an excellent prospect, but no one loved him as much as Mike Ditka.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The false consensus effect. </span>Put basically, <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">people tend to think that other people share their preferences.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Present bias. Team owners, coaches, and general managers all want to win now.</span></div></li><li><div>What would have to be true to make the price of early picks rational, and is it in fact true?</div></li><li><div>Some players are perennial all-stars who can transform a team. Others are complete busts that cost the team a lot of money and provide little in return. In fact, high-profile busts actually hurt performance because the teams are unable to ignore sunk costs. If a team is paying a high draft pick a lot of money, it feels under a lot of pressure to put him in the game, regardless of how well he is playing.</div></li><li><div>The primary implication of our analysis is that teams with early picks should trade down, that is, trade their early pick for multiple later picks. To test the validity of this strategy, we evaluated every two-for-one trade that would be possible using the Chart as a guideline. For example, the Chart indicates that the team with the first pick could trade it for picks seven and eight, four and twelve, two and fifty, and so forth. For each of these potential hypothetical trades, we looked to see how the team did by using two measures of player performance: games started and years elected as an all-star. We found that trading down yielded a large increase in games started with no sacrifice in the number of all-star seasons.</div></li><li><div>When an economist says of a team trading up, “That is just an agency problem,” they mean that the general manager or the coach is worried about his job and needs to win now or get fired. Of course, it is perfectly rational for coaches and general managers to be worried about losing their jobs—they do often get fired. But I think blaming their bad decision-making on traditional agency problems is a mischaracterization. In many of these situations, and not only in sports, the owner is at least as responsible for causing the problem as the employees. It is often the case that general managers trade up because the owner wants to win now.</div></li><li><div>A competitive labor market does do a pretty good job of channeling people into jobs that suit them. But ironically, this logic may become less compelling as we move up the managerial ladder. All economists are at least pretty good at economics, but many who are chosen to be department chair fail miserably at that job. This is the famous Peter Principle: people keep getting promoted until they reach their level of incompetence.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">As the importance of a decision grows, the tendency to rely on quantitative analyses done by others tends to shrink. When the championship or the future of the company is on the line, managers tend to rely on their gut instincts.</span></div></li><li><div>The more we learn about how professional teams work, the more we understand how difficult it is to get everyone in the organization to adopt strategies that maximize profits and games won, especially if those strategies violate conventional wisdom. It is clear that a necessary condition is to have clear buy-in from the top, starting with the owner, but then that owner has to convince everyone who works for him that they are really going to be rewarded for taking smart but unconventional chances, even (especially!) when they fail.</div></li></ul><li><div>Game Shows</div></li><ul><li><div>The fact that many behavioral phenomena, from overconfidence to the winner’s curse, predicted that early picks would be overvalued made it impossible to say which bit of misbehaving was producing the mispricing.</div></li><li><div>Does the way the game has played out influence the choices people make? Economic theory says that it shouldn’t. The only thing that should matter is the choice the contestant is now facing, not the good or bad luck that occurred along the way. The path is a SIF.</div></li><li><div>We found two situations that induce people to be less risk averse than normal, in fact, actively risk-seeking. The first is when they are ahead in the game and “playing with the house money.” The other is when they are behind in the game and have a chance to break even. The contestants on Deal or No Deal displayed the same tendencies, and for huge stakes.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Contestants clearly reacted not just to the gambles they were facing, but also to the gains and losses along the way.</span></div></li><li><div>The students were more risk averse in front of the crowd.</div></li><li><div>Contrary to the standard theory, in low-stakes experiments of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, about 40–50% of people cooperate.</div></li><li><div>Cooperation rates fall as the stakes rise only because when the stakes were unusually low by the standards of this show, cooperation rates were exceptionally high. My coauthors and I have a conjecture for why this happens that we call the “big peanuts” hypothesis. The idea is that a certain amount of money can seem small or large depending on the context. Recall from the List that people were willing to drive across town to save $10 on a small purchase but not a big one. Ten dollars in the context of buying a new television seems like “peanuts,” or not enough to worry about. We think the same thing happens on this show. Remember that the average prize pool in this game is about $20,000, so if a pair of contestants find themselves in a final where the pot is just $500, it feels like they are playing for peanuts. If they are playing for peanuts, why not be nice, especially on national television? Of course, $500 would be considered an extraordinarily large prize to be divided in the context of a laboratory experiment.</div></li><li><div>We investigated one other aspect of the behavior displayed on Golden Balls: could we predict who would split and who would steal? We analyzed a host of demographic variables, but the only significant finding is that <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">young men are distinctly less likely to split. Never trust a man under thirty.</span></div></li><li><div>We also analyzed the speeches each player makes before the big decision. Not surprisingly, the speeches all have the same flavor: “I am not the sort of person who would steal, and I hope you are not one of those evil types either.” This is an example of what game theorists call “cheap talk.” In the absence of a penalty for lying, everyone promises to be nice. However, there turns out to be one reliable signal in all this noise. If someone makes an explicit promise to split, she is 30 percentage points more likely to do so. (An example of such a statement: “I promise you I am going to split it, 120%.”) This reflects a general tendency. People are more willing to lie by omission than commission. If I am selling you a used car, I do not feel obligated to mention that the car is burning a lot of oil, but if you ask me explicitly: “Does this car burn a lot of oil?” you are likely to wangle an admission from me that yes, there has been a small problem along those lines. To get at the truth, it helps to ask specific questions.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div>HELPING OUT: 2004–PRESENT</div></li><ul><li><div>Could we use behavioral economics to make the world a better place?</div></li><li><div>Save More Tomorrow</div></li><ul><li><div>Standard theory starts with the assumption that people are saving the exact right amount (not to mention investing intelligently).</div></li><li><div>Even if an economist did want to help out on such a project, she would only have one policy tool to play with, namely the after-tax financial return on savings. The standard theories of saving such as those offered by Milton Friedman or Franco Modigliani implicitly make the very strong prediction that no other policy variable can matter, since the other factors that determine a household’s saving—such as age, income, life expectancy, and so forth—are not controlled by the government.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Higher rates of return mean that it takes less saving to achieve a given retirement savings goal. Someone who is trying to accumulate a specific nest egg can achieve that goal with less saving if rates of return go up.</span></div></li><li><div>One of the problems in determining the effect of a change in the tax law is that to qualify for the low tax rate investors have to satisfy other rules, such as putting the money in a special account, possibly with penalties for withdrawals before retirement. The special account may facilitate saving in two ways. First, the penalty for withdrawal acts as an inducement to leave the money invested. Second, a mental account that is designated as “retirement saving” is less tempting to dip into than a simple savings account.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The first obstacle is inertia. Surveys reveal that most people in retirement savings plans think they should be saving more, and plan to take action, uh, soon. But then they procrastinate, and never get around to changing their saving rate. In fact, most plan participants rarely make any changes to their saving options unless they change jobs and are confronted with a new set of forms they have to fill out</span>. Overcoming inertia is the problem that automatic enrollment magically solves. The same concept should be included in a plan to increase saving rates. If we could somehow get people started on a plan to increase their saving rates and let that kick in automatically, inertia could work for us instead of against us.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The second obstacle is loss aversion. We know that people hate losing and, in particular, hate to see their paychecks go down.</span> Based on the findings from our fairness study, we also know that in this domain, loss aversion is measured in nominal dollars, that is, without adjusting for inflation. So, if we could figure out a way that employees would not feel any cuts to their paychecks, there would be less resistance to saving more.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The third behavioral insight was related to self-control. A key finding from the research on this topic is that we have more self-control when it comes to the future than the present.</span> Even the kids in Walter Mischel’s marshmallow experiments would have no trouble if today they were given the choice between one marshmallow at 2 p.m. tomorrow or three marshmallows at 2:15 p.m. tomorrow. Yet, we know that if we give them that same choice tomorrow at 2 p.m., few would be able to wait until 2:15. They are present-biased.</div></li><li><div>By comparing the choices of people who joined before automatic enrollment with those who came after, Madrian and Shea were able to show that some employees would have selected a higher saving rate if left to their own devices. In particular, many employees had heretofore picked a 6% savings rate—the rate at which the employer stopped matching contributions. After automatic enrollment came in, there were fewer people choosing 6% and more choosing 3%. This is the downside of automatic enrollment.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Participation rates depended strongly on the ease with which employees could learn about the program and sign up.</span></div></li><li><div>Bulk of the saving generated by automatic saving plans is “new.” When someone moves to a company with a more generous retirement saving plan and automatically starts saving more via that plan, there is neither a discernible decrease in savings in other categories nor an increase in debt. In a world of Econs this result would be surprising because Econs treat money as fungible and are already saving just the right amount, so if an employee is forced or nudged into saving more in one place, she would just save less or borrow more somewhere else.</div></li><li><div>In allocating the source of the new saving that comes from these programs, the authors attribute only 1% of the increase to the tax breaks. The other 99% comes from the automatic features. They conclude: “In sum, the findings of our study call into question whether tax subsidies are the most effective policy to increase retirement savings. Automatic enrollment or default policies that nudge individuals to save more could have larger impacts on national saving at lower fiscal cost.”</div></li></ul><li><div>Going Public</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“Asymmetric Paternalism.” They defined their concept this way: “A regulation is asymmetrically paternalistic if it creates large benefits for those who make errors, while imposing little or no harm on those who are fully rational.”</span></div></li><li><div>In our increasingly complicated world people cannot be expected to have the expertise to make anything close to optimal decisions in all the domains in which they are forced to choose. But we all enjoy having the right to choose for ourselves, even if we sometimes make mistakes. Are there ways to make it easier for people to make what they will deem to be good decisions, both before and after the fact, without explicitly forcing anyone to do anything?</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Because people are Humans, not Econs (terms we coined for Nudge), they make predictable errors. If we can anticipate those errors, we can devise policies that will reduce the error rate.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">A nudge is some small feature in the environment that attracts our attention and influences behavior. Nudges are effective for Humans, but not for Econs, since Econs are already doing the right thing. Nudges are supposedly irrelevant factors that influence our choices in ways that make us better off.</span></div></li><li><div>What if we could design policies that were equally easy to create “user-centered” choice environments?</div></li><li><div>In countries where the default is to be a donor, almost no one opts out, but in countries with an opt-in policy, often less than half of the population opts in!</div></li><li><div>When people renew their driver’s license, they are asked whether they wish to be an organ donor. Simply asking people and immediately recording their choices makes it easy to sign up.† In Alaska and Montana, this approach has achieved donation rates exceeding 80%.</div></li></ul><li><div>Nudging in the U.K.</div></li><ul><li><div>The official mission of the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) was left broad: to achieve significant impact in at least two major areas of policy; to spread understanding of behavioral approaches across government; and to achieve at least a tenfold return on the cost of the unit. The basic idea was to use the findings of behavioral science to improve the workings of government.</div></li><li><div>if you want people to comply with some norm or rule, it is a good strategy to inform them (if true) that most other people comply.†</div></li><li><div>Everyone received a reminder letter explaining how their bill could be paid, and aside from the control condition, each letter contained a one-sentence nudge that was some variation on Cialdini’s basic theme that most people pay on time. Some examples:</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-style: italic;" data-mce-style="font-style: italic;">The great majority of people in the UK pay their taxes on time.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: italic;" data-mce-style="font-style: italic;">The great majority of people in your local area pay their taxes on time.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: italic;" data-mce-style="font-style: italic;">You are currently in the very small minority of people who have not paid their taxes on time.</span></div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Ethical nudges must be both transparent and true.</span></div></li><li><div>All the manipulations helped, but the most effective message combined two sentiments: most people pay and you are one of the few that hasn’t. This letter increased the number of taxpayers who made their payments within twenty-three days§ by over five percentage points. Since it does not cost anything extra to add a sentence to such letters, this is a highly cost-effective strategy. It is difficult to calculate exactly how much money was saved, since most people do pay their taxes eventually, but the experiment sped up the influx of £9 million in revenues to the government over the first twenty-three days.</div></li><li><div>I found myself repeating two things so often they became known as team mantras.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">If you want to encourage someone to do something, make it easy. </span></div></li><li><div>The first step in getting people to change their behavior as “unfreezing.” One way to unfreeze people is to remove barriers that are preventing them from changing, however subtle those barriers might be.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">We can’t do evidence-based policy without evidence.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">An equally important innovation was the insistence that all interventions be tested using, wherever possible, the gold-standard methodology of randomized control trials (RCTs)—the method often used in medical research.</span> In an RCT, people are assigned at random to receive different treatments (such as the wording of the letters in the tax study), including a control group that receives no treatment (in this case, the original wording).</div></li><li><div>Potential pitfalls of randomized controlled trials in field settings. Such experiments are expensive, and lots of stuff can go wrong. When a lab experiment gets fouled up, which happens all too often in labs run by Humans, a relatively small amount of money paid to subjects has been lost, but the experimenter can usually try again. Furthermore, smart experimenters run a cheap pilot first to detect any bugs in the setup. All of this is hard in large-scale field experiments, and to make matters worse, it is often not possible for the experimenters to be present, on site, at every step along the way. Of course, scientists skilled at running RCTs can reduce the risks of errors and screw-ups, but these risks will never disappear.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">It is also crucial to understand that many improvements may superficially appear to be quite small: a 1 or 2% change in some outcome. That should not be a reason to scoff, especially if the intervention is essentially costless. Indeed, there is a danger of falling into a trap similar to the “big peanuts” fallacy exhibited by the game show contestants. A 2% increase in the effectiveness of some program may not sound like a big deal, but when the stakes are in billions of dollars, small percentage changes add up.</span></div></li><li><div>These savings interventions combined three important ingredients that greatly increase the chance that a program will achieve its stated goal. First, the program designers have a good reason to believe that a portion of the population will benefit by making some change in their behavior. In this case, with many people saving little or nothing for retirement, that was an easy call. Second, the target population must agree that a change is desirable. Here, surveys indicated that a majority of employees thought they should be saving more. Third, it is possible to make the change with one nearly costless action (or in the case of automatic enrollment, no action at all). I call such policies “one-click” interventions. Simply by ticking a box, someone who signs up for Save More Tomorrow sets himself on a course that will increase his saving rate over time, with no need to do anything else.</div></li><li><div>Those looking for behavioral interventions that have a high probability of working should seek out other environments in which a one-time action can accomplish the job. If no one-time solution yet exists, invent one!</div></li><li><div>In a study in Ghana, the nonprofit Innovations for Poverty Action ran a randomized control trial testing whether text message reminders to take malaria medication helped people follow through with the medical regimen. Not only did they find these texts to be effective, but they also found that the most effective messages were brief; it was the reminder, not any additional information, which mattered.</div></li><li><div>most of economic theory is not derived from empirical observation. Instead, it is deduced from axioms of rational choice, whether or not those axioms bear any relation to what we observe in our lives every day. A theory of the behavior of Econs cannot be empirically based, because Econs do not exist.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">One intriguing finding by Roland Fryer suggests that rewarding students for inputs (such as doing their homework) rather than outputs (such as their grades) is effective.</span></div></li><li><div>Teachers who are given a bonus at the beginning of the school year that must be returned if they fail to meet some target, improve the performance of their students significantly more than teachers who are offered an end-of-year bonus contingent on meeting the same goals.¶</div></li><li><div>The pre-informing texts increased student performance on the math test by the equivalent of one additional month of schooling, and students in the bottom quartile benefited most. These children gained the equivalent of two additional months of schooling, relative to the control group. Afterward, both parents and students said they wanted to stick with the program, showing that they appreciated being nudged. This program also belies the frequent claim, unsupported by any evidence, that nudges must be secret to be effective.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Observe. Behavioral economics started with simple observations.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Collect data. Stories are powerful and memorable.</span> That is why I have told so many in this book. But an individual anecdote can only serve as an illustration. To really convince yourself, much less others, we need to change the way we do things: we need data, and lots of it. As Mark Twain once said, <strong>“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.”</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>The only protection against overconfidence is to systematically collect data, especially data that can prove you wrong.</strong></div></li><li><div>The ideal organizational environment encourages everyone to observe, collect data, and speak up. The bosses who create such environments are risking only one thing: a few bruises to their egos. That is a small price to pay for increasing the flow of new ideas and decreasing the risks of disasters."</div></li></ul></ul>

        <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><div>What growth hackers do is focus on the “who” and “where” more scientifically, in a more measurable way.</div></li><li><div>Whereas marketing was once brand based, with growth hacking it becomes metric and ROI driven.</div></li><li><div>how do you get, maintain, and multiply attention in a scalable and efficient way?</div></li><li><div>Growth hackers believe that products—even whole businesses and business models—can and should be changed until they are primed to generate explosive reactions from the first people who see them.</div></li><li><div>The best way to get to Product Market Fit is by starting with a “minimum viable product” and improving it based on feedback—as</div></li><li><div>“people [who are] thinking about things other than making the best product, never make the best product.”</div></li><li><div>The prize and spoils no longer go to the person who makes it to market first. They go to the person who makes it to Product Market Fit first.</div></li><li><div>Who is this product for? Why would they use it? Why do I use it?</div></li><li><div>Ask your customers questions, too: What is it that brought you to this product? What is holding you back from referring other people to it? What’s missing? What’s golden?</div></li><li><div>With growth hacking, we begin by testing until we can be confident we have a product worth marketing.</div></li><li><div>You couldn’t expect people to come to you; you had to pull them in.</div></li><li><div>Thinking like a growth hacker—it’s how you get the most bang for your buck and how you get it from the right people.</div></li><li><div>Do whatever it takes to pull in a small contingent of initial users from your particular space.</div></li><li><div>At a certain scale, awareness/brand building makes sense. But for the first year or two it’s a total waste of money.”</div></li><li><div>Why should customers do that? Have we actually made it easy for them to spread your product? Is the product even worth talking about?</div></li><li><div>Virality at its core is asking someone spend their social capital recommending or linking or posting about you for free.</div></li><li><div>Virality isn’t something that comes after the fact. Instead, the product must be inherently worth sharing—and then on top of that, you must facilitate and encourage the spreading you’d like to see by adding tools and campaigns that enable virality.</div></li><li><div>“Making things more observable makes them easier to imitate, which makes them more likely to become popular. . . . We need to design products and initiatives that advertise themselves and create behavioral residue that sticks around even after people have bought the product or espoused the idea.”</div></li><li><div>Growth hacker doesn’t think branding is worthless, just that it’s not worth the premium that traditional marketers pay for it</div></li><li><div>Growth hacker will look for ways to get this social currency for free.</div></li><li><div>You want to go viral, it must be baked into your product. There must be a reason to share it and the means to do so.</div></li><li><div><strong>Virality is not an accident. It is engineered.</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Job is not just to bring in potential customers but to create lifelong users.</strong></div></li><li><div>What’s the point of driving a bunch of new customers through marketing channels if they immediately leak out through a hole in the bottom? What’s the use of building up a certain perception of your product in the media and via marketing if the moment people try it they find out the hype isn’t true?</div></li><li><div>If you’ve built in viral features, the more your users stick, the more it will spread.</div></li><li><div>Even the best growth hacker cannot “grow a broken product.”</div></li><li><div>“the focus needs to be on improving customer retention.”</div></li><li><div>role of the growth hacker is to ruthlessly optimize incoming traffic for success.</div></li><li><div>a 5 percent increase in customer retention can mean a 30 percent increase in profitability for the company.</div></li><li><div>the probability of selling to an existing customer is 60–70 percent, while to a new prospect it’s just 5–20 percent.</div></li><li><div>At the core, marketing is lead generation.</div></li><li><div>anything that gets customers is marketing.</div></li><li><div>they merged marketing into their product development; they kicked off growth with early adopters; they added viral elements; and then they relentlessly repeated these cycles, always guided by the data, with an eye toward optimization.</div></li>

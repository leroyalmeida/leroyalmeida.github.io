        <ul>
          <li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">We should never forget that our need for logic and certainty brings costs as well as benefits. The need to appear scientific in our methodology may prevent us from considering other, less logical and more magical solutions, which can be cheap, fast-acting and effective.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">We also found, rather annoyingly, that the success of this approach did not always guarantee repeat business;</span></div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Entrepreneurs are disproportionately valuable precisely because they are not confined to doing only those things that make sense to a committee.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">The likes of Steve Jobs, James Dyson, Elon Musk and Peter Thiel often seem certifiably bonkers;</span></div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">When you demand logic, you pay a hidden price: you destroy magic.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">In real life, most things arenâ€™t logical â€“ they are psycho-logical.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">There are often two reasons behind peopleâ€™s behaviour: the ostensibly logical reason, and the real reason.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">There is an ostensible, rational, self-declared reason why we do things, and there is also a cryptic or hidden purpose.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Humans are a deeply social species (which may mean tha</span><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">t research into human behaviour or choices in artificial experiments where there is no social context isnâ€™t really all that useful).</span></div></li></ul><li><div>More data leads to better decisions, except when it doesnâ€™t.</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Big data all comes from the past</span></div></li><li><div>A single rogue variable, or a â€˜black swanâ€™ event, can throw the most perfectly calibrated model into chaos</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">In theory, you canâ€™t be too logical, but in practice, you can.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">To solve logic-proof problems requires intelligent, logical people to admit the possibility that they might be wrong about something, but these peopleâ€™s minds are often most resistant to change â€“ perhaps because their status is deeply entwined with their capacity for reason.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>We could never have evolved to be rationalâ€”it makes you weak</div></li><ul><li><div>Irrational people are much more powerful than rational people, because their threats are so much more convincing</div></li><li><div>A rational leader suggests changing course to avoid a storm. An irrational one can change the weather.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Being slightly bonkers can be a good negotiating strategy: being rational means you are predictable, and being predictable makes you weak.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">If you are wholly predictable, people learn to hack you.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Reality isnâ€™t nearly as logical as we think</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">In a designed system, one thing does serve one narrow purpose. In an evolved, complex system, or in human behaviour, things can have multiple uses depending on the context within which they are viewed.</span></div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Avoid the trap of assuming the same skills that can explain the past can be used to predict the future.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>What looks neat and logical when viewed in hindsight is usually much messier in real time</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Two forms of scientific enquiryâ€”the discovery of what works and the explanation and understanding of why it works</span></div></li><ul><li><div>A plausible â€˜whyâ€™ should not be a pre-requisite in deciding a â€˜what'</div></li><li><div>The things we try should not be confined to those things whose future success we can most easily explain in retrospect</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">There is much more value to be found in understanding how people behave in reality than how they should behave in theory.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Behavioural economics might well be described as the study of the nonsensical and the non-sensical aspects of human behaviour.</span></div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">A gift for oneâ€™s child â€“ might be more emotionally rewarding than a cash reward, which is a gain for oneself.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Evolution is like a brilliant uneducated craftsman: what it lacks in intellect it makes up for in experience.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Be careful before calling something nonsense.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Something can be valuable without necessarily being valuable all the time.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Whether something makes sense in theory matters less than whether it works in practice.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Just because we donâ€™t know why it works, we should not be blind to the fact that it does.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">the single greatest strength of free markets is their ability to generate innovative things whose popularity makes no sense.</span></div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Once you accept that there may be a value or purpose to things that are hard to justify, you will naturally come to another conclusion: that </span><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">it is perfectly possible to be both rational and wrong.</span></div></li><li><div>Logical ideas often fail because logic demands universally applicable laws but humans, unlike atoms, are not consistent enough in their behaviour for such laws to hold very broadly.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">â€˜Contextâ€™ is often the most important thing in determining how people think, behave and act</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">There are two equally potent, but completely contradictory, ways to sell a product: â€˜Not many people own one of these, so it must be goodâ€™ and â€˜Lots of people already own one of these, so it must be good.â€™</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">The principles of selling and behaviour change are imbued with contradictions.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">In psychology the opposite of a good idea can be a very good idea indeed: both opposites often work.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Our very perception of the world is affected by context,</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">It is much easier to be fired for being illogical than it is for being unimaginative.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">The problem that bedevils organisations once they reach a certain size* is that narrow, conventional logic is the natural mode of thinking for the risk-averse bureaucrat or executive.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">you can never be fired for being logical.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">If your reasoning is sound and unimaginative, even if you fail, it is unlikely you will attract much blame.</span></div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">logic always gets you to exactly the same place as your competitors.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: normal;

font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">The world runs on two operating systems.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">The much smaller of them runs on conventional logic.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">The logical and the psycho-logical approaches run on different operating systems and require different software, and we need to understand both.</span></div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-style: normal;

We acquire it as a means of signalling our commitment to long-term, mutually beneficial behaviours,</span></div></li><li><div>Solving a problem for a customer at your own expense is a good way of signalling your commitment to a future relationship.</div></li><li><div>Theory of â€˜continuation probabilityâ€™ would also predict that, when a business focuses narrowly on short-term profit maximisation, it will appear less trustworthy to its customers, something that seems all too plausible.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">â€˜Costly signalling theoryâ€™, the fact that the meaning and significance attached to a something is in direct proportion to the expense with which it is communicated.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Bits deliver information, but costliness carries meaning.</div></li></ul><li><div>We notice and attach significance and meaning to those things that deviate from narrow, economic common sense, precisely because they deviate from it. The result of this is that the pursuit of narrow economic rationalism will produce a world rich in goods, but deficient in meaning.</div></li><li><div>Effective communication will always require some degree of irrationality in its creation because if itâ€™s perfectly rational it becomes, like water, entirely lacking in flavour.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">It is difficult to produce good advertising, but good advertising is only good because it is difficult to produce.</span></div></li><li><div>The potency and meaningfulness of communication is in direct proportion to the costliness of its creation â€“ the amount of pain, effort, talent (or failing that, expensive celebrities or pricey TV airtime) consumed in its creation and distribution. This may be inefficient â€“ but itâ€™s what makes it work.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Meaning is conveyed by the things we do that are not in our own short-term self-interestâ€”by the costs that we incur and the risks we take.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">All powerful messages must contain an element of absurdity, illogicality, costliness, disproportion, inefficiency, scarcity, difficulty or extravagance â€“ because rational behaviour and talk, for all their strengths, convey no meaning.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">It is only by deviating from a narrow, short-term self-interest that we can generate anything more than cheap talk.</span></div></li><li><div>It is therefore impossible to generate trust, affection, respect, reputation, status, loyalty, generosity or sexual opportunity by simply pursuing the dictates of rational economic theory.</div></li><li><div>We draw unconscious inferences from environmental cues everywhere we go, without having the slightest awareness that we are doing so â€“ it is thinking without thinking that we are thinking.</div></li></ul><li><div>We have developed the ability to arrive at pretty good, non-catastrophic decisions based on limited, non-numerical information,</div></li><li><div>In nature, it is often necessary for something to present a persuasive message, and in a way that canâ€™t be faked.</div></li><li><div>There is no point in advertising heavily up front if you only make one sale.</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">It is only by having a recognisable identity that a flower is able to improve the value exchange* and increase the chance of repeat visits.</span></div></li><li><div>Since at the moment you make a purchase decision, the advertiser knows more about his product than you do, a costly demonstration of faith by the seller may well be the most reliable indicator of whether something is at least worthy of consideration (remember the Knowledge with London taxi drivers).</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Doing something ostensibly irrational conveys more meaning than something that makes sense. It has meaning precisely because it is difficult to do.</span></div></li><li><div>A quality that starts off being prized as a useful proxy for fitness becomes exaggerated to an absurd degree, a process sometimes known as Fisherian runaway selection.</div></li><li><div>Different forms of status seeking have effects on the wider populations that range from the highly beneficial to the downright disastrous.</div></li><ul><li><div>In the early stages of any significant innovation, there may be an awkward stage where the new product is no better than what it is seeking to replace.</div></li><li><div>The appeal of these products was based on their status as much as their utility.</div></li></ul><li><div>Many innovations would not have got off the ground without the human instinct for status-signalling,* so might it be the same in nature?</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Costly signalling can lead to economic inefficiency, but at the same time this inefficiency establishes valuable social qualities such as trustworthiness and commitment â€“ politeness and good manners are costly signalling in a face-to-face form.</span></div></li><li><div>Why is there a reluctance to accept that life is not just a narrow pursuit of greater efficiency and that there is room for opulence and display as well?</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">As neuroscientists have observed, we donâ€™t so much choose brands as use them to aid choice. And when a choice baffles us, we take the safe default option â€“ which is to do nothing at all.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>We felt uneasy buying something that cost a few hundred pounds without the reassurance of a recognisable name. British ad-man Robin Wight calls this instinct â€˜the Reputation Reflexâ€™</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">â€˜Information asymmetryâ€™, whereby the seller knows more about what he is selling than the buyer knows about what he is buying.</span></div></li><li><div>Without the feedback loop made possible by distinctive and distinguishable petals or brands, nothing can improve. The loop exists because insects or people learn to differentiate between the more and less rewarding plants or brands, and then direct their behaviour accordingly.</div></li><li><div>Without this mechanism there is no incentive to improve your product, because the benefits will accrue to everybody equally; in addition, there is an ever-present incentive to let product quality slip, because you will reap the immediate gains, while the reputational consequences will hurt everyone else equally.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Branding isnâ€™t just something to add to great products â€“ itâ€™s essential to their existence.</span></div></li><li><div>Without this assurance of quality, there simply isnâ€™t enough trust for markets to function at all, which means that perfectly good ideas can fail.</div></li></ul><li><div>The fact that something does not work through a known and logical mechanism should not make us unwilling to adopt it.</div></li><li><div>Research into the placebo effect shows that branded analgesics are more effective.</div></li><li><div>Our unconscious, specifically our â€˜adaptive unconsciousâ€™ as psychologist Timothy Wilson calls it in Strangers to Ourselves (2002), does not notice or process information in the same way we do consciously, and does not speak the same language that our consciousness does, but it holds the reins when it comes to much of our behaviour.</div></li><li><div>The same applies to human free will: we can control our actions and emotions to some extent, but we cannot do so directly, so we have to learn to do it indirectly</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">This indirect process of influence applies to all complex systems,</span></div></li><li><div>The problems we face arise because policy problems are given to the intellectual equivalent of manual car drivers, who believe that the only acceptable way to change gear is to use a gearstick, rather than indirectly with an accelerator pedal.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">You can use conscious mechanisms to produce unconscious effects.</span></div></li><li><div>The actions required to create such conditions may involve a certain degree of what appears to be bullshit â€“ but it is only bullshit when you donâ€™t know what its reason is.</div></li></ul><li><div>â€˜The conscious mind thinks itâ€™s the Oval Office, when in reality itâ€™s the press office.â€™</div></li><li><div>We believe we are issuing executive orders, while most of the time we are actually engaged in hastily constructing plausible post-rationalisations to explain decisions taken somewhere else, for reasons we do not understand</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">We pretend that conscious human agency is the only force that drives our behaviour, and therefore disparage other less obvious behaviours that we have adopted to hack our unconscious processes as if they were irrational, wasteful or absurd</span></div></li><li><div>Humphrey suggests that our bodyâ€™s immune system is calibrated to suit a much tougher environment than the one in which we find ourselves.</div></li><li><div>The human immune system has over time been calibrated to promote survival in conditions far harsher than those of today.</div></li><li><div>We all spend a considerable amount of time and money essentially signalling to ourselves: many of the things we do are not be intended to advertise anything about ourselves to others â€“ we are, in effect, advertising to ourselves</div></li><li><div>Humans regularly deployed oblique methods to generate bodily states and emotions which, like our immune response, we cannot consciously will into action â€“ but which we can coax into existence</div></li><li><div>There is an important lesson in evaluating human behaviour: never denigrate a behaviour as irrational until you have considered what purpose it really serves.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Most products have both an ostensible, â€˜officialâ€™ function and an ulterior function.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The only way you can discover what people really want (their â€˜revealed preferencesâ€™, in economic parlance) is through seeing what they actually pay for under a variety of different conditions, in a variety of contexts. This requires trial and error â€“ which requires competitive markets and marketing.</span></div></li><li><div>Many pedestrian crossings have buttons that also have no effect at all â€“ the traffic lights are set to a timed sequence.* However, here the presence of the button is a rather more benign lie: how many fewer people would wait for the green man if there were no button to press? And how many more people would wait for the green man if there were a digital display of the seconds to wait before its appearance? In countries including Korea and China, accidents at intersections have been reduced by simply displaying the number of seconds remaining before the lights turn green.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The mammalian brain has a deep-set preference for control and certainty.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">More is spent on female beauty than on education.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>a large part of the two trillion dollars spent on female self-beautification is not spent in order to appeal to the opposite sex;</div></li><li><div>a significant part of what youâ€™re doing when you spend two hours on self-grooming is self-administering a confidence placebo to produce emotions that you canâ€™t generate through a conscious act of will.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">One of Nicholas Humphreyâ€™s rules about what makes an effective placebo is that there must be some effort, scarcity or expense involved.</span></div></li><li><div>Although everyone had drunk exactly the same drink, the â€˜vodka Red Bull groupâ€™ reported feeling much drunker, took more risks than the others and were more confident when it came to approaching women. Furthermore, the effect appeared to be stronger in men who believed that mixing energy drinks and alcohol makes you take risks and reduces inhibitions, suggesting that the altered behaviour is not caused by the drinkâ€™s composition but by what you believe it does to you.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Much luxury goods expenditure can only be explained in this way â€“ either people are seeking to impress each other, or they are seeking to impress themselves.*</span></div></li><li><div>The branding of Red Bull, through slogans like â€˜Red Bull gives you wingsâ€™ or the extreme sport competitions they sponsor, may not merely determine whether people buy the product but also how they respond to its name in a cocktail and how they interpret its effects.</div></li><li><div>Even if the contents arenâ€™t particularly poisonous or potent, our inner monkey can deduce that they are â€“ remember that the prefrontal cortex isnâ€™t involved in this decision at all, and that it is the monkey alone who decides whether a placebo works.</div></li><li><div>So signalling to ourselves or others â€“ whether to obtain a health benefit (boosting the immune system), applying make-up (boosting confidence) or buying luxury goods (boosting status) â€“ always seems to come accompanied by behaviours that donâ€™t make sense when viewed from a logical perspective. However, rather than being a coincidence or a regrettable by-product, it may be a necessity.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Things which involve a degree of sacrifice seem to have a heightened effect on the unconscious, precisely because they do not make logical sense.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>The qualities we notice, and the things which often affect us most, are the things that make no sense â€“ at some level, perhaps it is necessary to deviate from standard rationality and do something apparently illogical to attract the attention of the subconscious and create meaning.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Placebos need to be slightly absurd to work.</span></div></li><li><div>If you look at behaviours to hack the unconscious, they all seem to have an element that is wasteful, unpleasant or downright silly</div></li><li><div>Do these various things work despite the fact that they are illogical, or do they work precisely because they are?</div></li><ul><li><div>And if our unconscious instincts are programmed to respond to and to generate behaviours precisely because they deviate from economic optimality, what might be the evolutionary reason for this?</div></li><li><div>Meaning is disproportionately conveyed by things that are unexpected or illogical, while narrowly logical things convey no information at all.</div></li></ul>

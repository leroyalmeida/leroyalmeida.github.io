Psycho-logic often believes that less is more.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>By removing the recording function from Walkmans, Sony produced a product that had a lower range of functionality, but a far greater potential to a change behaviour.</div></li><li><div>By reducing the possible applications of the device to a single use, it clarified what the device was for.</div></li><li><div>It is always possible to add functionality to something, but while this makes the new thing more versatile, it also reduces the clarity of its affordance, making it less pleasurable to use and quite possibly more difficult to justify buying.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The Walkman also exploits a clear psychological heuristic, or rule of thumb – ‘the jack-of-all-trades-heuristic’, whereby we naturally assume that something that only does one thing is better than something that claims to do many things.</span></div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">It is surprisingly common for significant innovations to emerge from the removal of features rather than the addition.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">If you want to offer ease of use – and ease of purchase – it is often a good idea not to offer people a Swiss Army knife, something that claims to do lots of things.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>With the notable exception of the mobile phone, we generally find it easier to buy things that serve a single purpose.</div></li></ul><li><div>The strongest marketing approach in a business-to-business context comes not from explaining that your product is good, but from sowing fear, uncertainty and doubt (now commonly abbreviated as FUD) around the available alternatives.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Signalling, the need to send reliable indications of commitment and intent, which can inspire confidence and trust</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Cooperation is impossible unless a mechanism is in place to prevent deception and cheating; some degree of efficiency often needs to be sacrificed in order to convey trustworthiness or to build a reputation.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Reciprocation, reputation and pre-commitment signalling are the three big mechanisms that underpin trust.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Uber is a taxi company with different mechanisms to promote trust.</div></li><li><div>The Knowledge is an upfront expense that is proof of long-term commitment.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Many things which do not make sense in a logical context suddenly make perfect sense if you consider what they mean rather than what they are.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>The reason for that is that the Ultimatum Game is stupid, and so is the Prisoner’s Dilemma: these games exist in a context-free, theoretical universe with no real-life parallels. They both posit the idea of the one-shot exchange, a transaction involving two strangers with no knowledge of the other’s identity. In the real world, such transactions never take largely place</div></li><ul><li><div>We choose to buy things in shops, not from random strangers in the street.</div></li><li><div>When we engage in transactions, we are generally aware of the other party’s identity and can see clues to their commitment.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Reputation is a form of skin in the game: it takes far longer to acquire a reputation than to lose one.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Upfront investment is proof of long-term commitment, which is a guarantor of honest behaviour.</span></div></li><li><div>The prospect of repeat custom is something that keeps businesses honest,</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">What keeps the relationship honest and mutually beneficial is nothing other than the prospect of repetition.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Unlike short-term expediency, long-term self-interest, as the evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers has shown, often leads to behaviours that are indistinguishable from mutually beneficial cooperation.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Prospects for cooperation are far greater when there is a high expectation of repetition than in single-shot transactions.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Social capital as ‘the shadow of the future at a societal scale’. We acquire it as a means of signalling our commitment to long-term, mutually beneficial behaviours,</span></div></li><li><div>Solving a problem for a customer at your own expense is a good way of signalling your commitment to a future relationship.</div></li><li><div>Theory of ‘continuation probability’ would also predict that, when a business focuses narrowly on short-term profit maximisation, it will appear less trustworthy to its customers, something that seems all too plausible.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">‘Costly signalling theory’, the fact that the meaning and significance attached to a something is in direct proportion to the expense with which it is communicated.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Bits deliver information, but costliness carries meaning.</div></li></ul><li><div>We notice and attach significance and meaning to those things that deviate from narrow, economic common sense, precisely because they deviate from it. The result of this is that the pursuit of narrow economic rationalism will produce a world rich in goods, but deficient in meaning.</div></li><li><div>Effective communication will always require some degree of irrationality in its creation because if it’s perfectly rational it becomes, like water, entirely lacking in flavour.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">It is difficult to produce good advertising, but good advertising is only good because it is difficult to produce.</span></div></li><li><div>The potency and meaningfulness of communication is in direct proportion to the costliness of its creation – the amount of pain, effort, talent (or failing that, expensive celebrities or pricey TV airtime) consumed in its creation and distribution. This may be inefficient – but it’s what makes it work.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Meaning is conveyed by the things we do that are not in our own short-term self-interest—by the costs that we incur and the risks we take.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">All powerful messages must contain an element of absurdity, illogicality, costliness, disproportion, inefficiency, scarcity, difficulty or extravagance – because rational behaviour and talk, for all their strengths, convey no meaning.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">It is only by deviating from a narrow, short-term self-interest that we can generate anything more than cheap talk.</span></div></li><li><div>It is therefore impossible to generate trust, affection, respect, reputation, status, loyalty, generosity or sexual opportunity by simply pursuing the dictates of rational economic theory.</div></li><li><div>We draw unconscious inferences from environmental cues everywhere we go, without having the slightest awareness that we are doing so – it is thinking without thinking that we are thinking.</div></li></ul><li><div>We have developed the ability to arrive at pretty good, non-catastrophic decisions based on limited, non-numerical information,</div></li><li><div>In nature, it is often necessary for something to present a persuasive message, and in a way that can’t be faked.</div></li><li><div>There is no point in advertising heavily up front if you only make one sale.</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">It is only by having a recognisable identity that a flower is able to improve the value exchange* and increase the chance of repeat visits.</span></div></li><li><div>Since at the moment you make a purchase decision, the advertiser knows more about his product than you do, a costly demonstration of faith by the seller may well be the most reliable indicator of whether something is at least worthy of consideration (remember the Knowledge with London taxi drivers).</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Doing something ostensibly irrational conveys more meaning than something that makes sense. It has meaning precisely because it is difficult to do.</span></div></li><li><div>A quality that starts off being prized as a useful proxy for fitness becomes exaggerated to an absurd degree, a process sometimes known as Fisherian runaway selection.</div></li><li><div>Different forms of status seeking have effects on the wider populations that range from the highly beneficial to the downright disastrous.</div></li><ul><li><div>In the early stages of any significant innovation, there may be an awkward stage where the new product is no better than what it is seeking to replace.</div></li><li><div>The appeal of these products was based on their status as much as their utility.</div></li></ul><li><div>Many innovations would not have got off the ground without the human instinct for status-signalling,* so might it be the same in nature?</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Costly signalling can lead to economic inefficiency, but at the same time this inefficiency establishes valuable social qualities such as trustworthiness and commitment – politeness and good manners are costly signalling in a face-to-face form.</span></div></li><li><div>Why is there a reluctance to accept that life is not just a narrow pursuit of greater efficiency and that there is room for opulence and display as well?</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">As neuroscientists have observed, we don’t so much choose brands as use them to aid choice. And when a choice baffles us, we take the safe default option – which is to do nothing at all.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>We felt uneasy buying something that cost a few hundred pounds without the reassurance of a recognisable name. British ad-man Robin Wight calls this instinct ‘the Reputation Reflex’</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">‘Information asymmetry’, whereby the seller knows more about what he is selling than the buyer knows about what he is buying.</span></div></li><li><div>Without the feedback loop made possible by distinctive and distinguishable petals or brands, nothing can improve. The loop exists because insects or people learn to differentiate between the more and less rewarding plants or brands, and then direct their behaviour accordingly.</div></li><li><div>Without this mechanism there is no incentive to improve your product, because the benefits will accrue to everybody equally; in addition, there is an ever-present incentive to let product quality slip, because you will reap the immediate gains, while the reputational consequences will hurt everyone else equally.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Branding isn’t just something to add to great products – it’s essential to their existence.</span></div></li><li><div>Without this assurance of quality, there simply isn’t enough trust for markets to function at all, which means that perfectly good ideas can fail.</div></li></ul><li><div>The fact that something does not work through a known and logical mechanism should not make us unwilling to adopt it.</div></li><li><div>Research into the placebo effect shows that branded analgesics are more effective.</div></li><li><div>Our unconscious, specifically our ‘adaptive unconscious’ as psychologist Timothy Wilson calls it in Strangers to Ourselves (2002), does not notice or process information in the same way we do consciously, and does not speak the same language that our consciousness does, but it holds the reins when it comes to much of our behaviour.</div></li><li><div>The same applies to human free will: we can control our actions and emotions to some extent, but we cannot do so directly, so we have to learn to do it indirectly</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">This indirect process of influence applies to all complex systems,</span></div></li><li><div>The problems we face arise because policy problems are given to the intellectual equivalent of manual car drivers, who believe that the only acceptable way to change gear is to use a gearstick, rather than indirectly with an accelerator pedal.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">You can use conscious mechanisms to produce unconscious effects.</span></div></li><li><div>The actions required to create such conditions may involve a certain degree of what appears to be bullshit – but it is only bullshit when you don’t know what its reason is.</div></li></ul><li><div>‘The conscious mind thinks it’s the Oval Office, when in reality it’s the press office.’</div></li><li><div>We believe we are issuing executive orders, while most of the time we are actually engaged in hastily constructing plausible post-rationalisations to explain decisions taken somewhere else, for reasons we do not understand</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">We pretend that conscious human agency is the only force that drives our behaviour, and therefore disparage other less obvious behaviours that we have adopted to hack our unconscious processes as if they were irrational, wasteful or absurd</span></div></li><li><div>Humphrey suggests that our body’s immune system is calibrated to suit a much tougher environment than the one in which we find ourselves.</div></li><li><div>The human immune system has over time been calibrated to promote survival in conditions far harsher than those of today.</div></li><li><div>We all spend a considerable amount of time and money essentially signalling to ourselves: many of the things we do are not be intended to advertise anything about ourselves to others – we are, in effect, advertising to ourselves</div></li><li><div>Humans regularly deployed oblique methods to generate bodily states and emotions which, like our immune response, we cannot consciously will into action – but which we can coax into existence</div></li><li><div>There is an important lesson in evaluating human behaviour: never denigrate a behaviour as irrational until you have considered what purpose it really serves.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Most products have both an ostensible, ‘official’ function and an ulterior function.</span></div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The only way you can discover what people really want (their ‘revealed preferences’, in economic parlance) is through seeing what they actually pay for under a variety of different conditions, in a variety of contexts. This requires trial and error – which requires competitive markets and marketing.</span></div></li><li><div>Many pedestrian crossings have buttons that also have no effect at all – the traffic lights are set to a timed sequence.* However, here the presence of the button is a rather more benign lie: how many fewer people would wait for the green man if there were no button to press? And how many more people would wait for the green man if there were a digital display of the seconds to wait before its appearance? In countries including Korea and China, accidents at intersections have been reduced by simply displaying the number of seconds remaining before the lights turn green.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">The mammalian brain has a deep-set preference for control and certainty.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">More is spent on female beauty than on education.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>a large part of the two trillion dollars spent on female self-beautification is not spent in order to appeal to the opposite sex;</div></li><li><div>a significant part of what you’re doing when you spend two hours on self-grooming is self-administering a confidence placebo to produce emotions that you can’t generate through a conscious act of will.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">One of Nicholas Humphrey’s rules about what makes an effective placebo is that there must be some effort, scarcity or expense involved.</span></div></li><li><div>Although everyone had drunk exactly the same drink, the ‘vodka Red Bull group’ reported feeling much drunker, took more risks than the others and were more confident when it came to approaching women. Furthermore, the effect appeared to be stronger in men who believed that mixing energy drinks and alcohol makes you take risks and reduces inhibitions, suggesting that the altered behaviour is not caused by the drink’s composition but by what you believe it does to you.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Much luxury goods expenditure can only be explained in this way – either people are seeking to impress each other, or they are seeking to impress themselves.*</span></div></li><li><div>The branding of Red Bull, through slogans like ‘Red Bull gives you wings’ or the extreme sport competitions they sponsor, may not merely determine whether people buy the product but also how they respond to its name in a cocktail and how they interpret its effects.</div></li><li><div>Even if the contents aren’t particularly poisonous or potent, our inner monkey can deduce that they are – remember that the prefrontal cortex isn’t involved in this decision at all, and that it is the monkey alone who decides whether a placebo works.</div></li><li><div>So signalling to ourselves or others – whether to obtain a health benefit (boosting the immune system), applying make-up (boosting confidence) or buying luxury goods (boosting status) – always seems to come accompanied by behaviours that don’t make sense when viewed from a logical perspective. However, rather than being a coincidence or a regrettable by-product, it may be a necessity.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Things which involve a degree of sacrifice seem to have a heightened effect on the unconscious, precisely because they do not make logical sense.</span></div></li><ul><li><div>The qualities we notice, and the things which often affect us most, are the things that make no sense – at some level, perhaps it is necessary to deviate from standard rationality and do something apparently illogical to attract the attention of the subconscious and create meaning.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Placebos need to be slightly absurd to work.</span></div></li><li><div>If you look at behaviours to hack the unconscious, they all seem to have an element that is wasteful, unpleasant or downright silly</div></li><li><div>Do these various things work despite the fact that they are illogical, or do they work precisely because they are?</div></li><ul><li><div>And if our unconscious instincts are programmed to respond to and to generate behaviours precisely because they deviate from economic optimality, what might be the evolutionary reason for this?</div></li><li><div>Meaning is disproportionately conveyed by things that are unexpected or illogical, while narrowly logical things convey no information at all.</div></li></ul>

          <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><div>Prologue</div></li><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Sophocles: “One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been.”</span></div></li><li><div>When he returned from a combat tour in Korea to become an instructor at the Fighter Weapons School—the Air Force’s premier dogfighting academy—he became known as <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“Forty-Second Boyd,” the pilot who could defeat any opponent in simulated air-to-air combat in less than forty seconds.</span></div></li><li><div>Like any gunslinger with a nickname and a reputation, Boyd was called out. Some of the best pilots in the Air Force challenged him at one time or another. So did the best pilots in the Navy and the Marine Corps. But no man could be found who was better in the air than John Boyd. He was never defeated.</div></li><li><div>But in 1959, when he was just a young captain, John Boyd became the first man to codify the elusive and mysterious ways of air-to-air combat. He developed and wrote the “Aerial Attack Study,” a document that became official Air Force doctrine, the bible of air combat—first in America, and then, when it was declassified, for air forces around the world. Put another way, while still a junior officer, John Boyd changed the way every air force in the world flies and fights.</div></li><li><div>Suddenly what he had learned in thermodynamics meshed with all that he had learned as a fighter pilot and Boyd had the epiphany that became his Energy-Maneuverability (E-M) Theory.</div></li><li><div>Knowledge gained from E-M made the F-15 and F-16 the finest aircraft of their type in the world. Boyd is acknowledged as the father of those two aircraft.</div></li><li><div>All his life Boyd was pursued by enemies real and imagined. He reacted the only way he knew how: by attacking. The rank or position of his enemy, the size or significance of the institution, none of it mattered. He attacked. And when Boyd attacked, he gave no quarter. Time after time he outmaneuvered his foes and sent them down to ignominious defeat.</div></li></ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Part One: FIGHTER PILOT</span></div></li><ul><li><div>Chapter One: Haunted Beginnings</div></li><ul><li><div>Never tell people what you don’t want repeated, she preached. People will seek out your weaknesses and faults, so tell them only of your strong points. No family matters must ever be mentioned beyond the front door.</div></li><li><div>During junior high, John tried his hand at running track but soon dropped out. He did not go out for football, basketball, or baseball. He knew he was only average in those sports and he had no time for activities in which he was average. But when he entered the swimming pool, he discovered that the long summer days at Lake Erie had not been wasted. He was an outstanding swimmer.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Two: The Big Jock and the Presbytreian</div></li><ul><li><div>After basic training he was ordered to Lowry Field in Colorado to be trained as a mechanic for aircraft turrets, but World War II ended that summer and there no longer was a need for such a specialty.</div></li><li><div>Boyd—after months at a staging area in Arizona—went to Japan as part of the occupation force. He arrived on January 3, 1946, and was assigned to the 8th Squadron of the 49th Fighter Group. His military records show that less than two months later, in order “to meet service requirements,” he became a swimming instructor.</div></li><li><div>When summer ended, Boyd left for the University of Iowa to study economics. He picked Iowa because of David Armbruster, the legendary swimming coach who established swimming as a sport at Iowa in 1917 and who was credited with developing the butterfly stroke and the flip turn.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">And when he talked he talked loudly and waved his arms and embellished the simplest of stories and made the world new and interesting and exciting.</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Three: Fledgling</div></li><ul><li><div>And then he went out and threw the T-6 around the sky in such a fearless manner that it seemed to others as if he had done it a thousand times. It was difficult for his classmates to accept that he was a student just as they were, that he had never had flying lessons until now. He was, quite simply, a master of the T-6.</div></li><li><div>If the book said the aircraft should never exceed 260 mph, Boyd pushed it to 265 or 270 or 280. He knew intuitively by the sound of the aircraft when it was approaching not the book limits but the true limits, which, for those bold enough to search for them, always are slightly greater.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">Fighter pilots—that is, the ones who survive air combat—are not gentlemen; they are back-stabbing assassins.</span></div></li><li><div>If a pilot were not trained to a sufficient level of skill, the aggressive MiG pilots, many of whom were highly professional Russians, would shoot him down in his first engagement. So at Nellis the idea was to push the aircraft beyond the envelope, to make the training as much like combat as possible. The saying of the time was <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-style="font-weight: bold;">“The more you bleed in peace time, the less you bleed in war.”</span></div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Four: K-13 and Mig Alley</div></li><ul><li><div>Rarely in the life of a man are successes so clearly stacked one atop the other in a precise, easy-to-see evolution as they are in the life of John Boyd. The accomplishments of Korea are the foundation of that evolution. First, Boyd’s ability as a pilot was outstanding.</div></li><li><div>On days when there were no reconnaissance flights, the pilots slid into their Sabres, climbed to 30,000 feet, and fought until the fuel was exhausted. Boyd clearly was the best F-86 driver in the squadron, so good that on October 20, 1953, he was made the assistant operations officer.</div></li><li><div>By now Boyd also was becoming known as a talker, and about the only thing he talked about was airto-air combat. He had a one-track mind. He talked as fast as he ate, and he could do both at the same time.</div></li><li><div>He talked so much and so often and so loudly about tactics that on November 25 he was made a flight commander and tactics instructor for the squadron. (The Air Force later changed the “tactics instructor” title to “weapons officer.”)</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Five: High Priest</div></li><ul><li><div>The motto at Nellis was <strong>“Every Man a Tiger”</strong> and to be called a tiger by a senior fighter pilot was the ultimate accolade. To be called a tiger meant you had stainless-steel testicles that dragged the ground and struck sparks when you walked. To be called a tiger meant you were a pure fighter pilot and that you would not hesitate to tell a bird colonel to get fucked.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>When a pilot augered in, screwed the pooch, fucked the duck, and bought the farm, then the base siren wailed and the blue car drove slowly and wives stood in the windows and the chaplain consoled and the flag hung at half staff. But it always happened to someone else, never to the best fighter pilot in the world. And if you have to ask who the best is, it sure as hell ain’t you.</div></li><li><div><strong>Fighter pilots fly with their fangs out and their hair on fire and they look death in the face every day and you ain’t shit if you ain’t done it.</strong></div></li><li><div>Like most people who find a cause, he had little patience for those who did not understand or who disagreed with what he was doing. Boyd never suffered lightly the careerists or bureaucrats or others who did not understand his ideas. Most of the time he showed the proper military courtesy.</div></li><li><div>One study showed that the toughest evaluators of their peers in the Air Force were fighter pilots, followed closely by nurses. By openly arguing with his superiors, by criticizing them, Boyd only increased this tendency toward harsh judgment.</div></li><li><div>The FWS has always been the most difficult and demanding school a fighter pilot can attend. Technically, young pilots can apply; in reality they are invited. They come out of basic flying school, are assigned to a squadron, and are watched for four or five years by their superiors and by former FWS graduates. If they are the best fighter pilots in their squadrons, if they are bold and aggressive, if they preach the gospel of fighter aviation, then they might be invited to the FWS.</div></li><li><div>Once in a great while there came along a pilot whose knowledge of air-to-air combat was so great and whose skills were so exemplary that he did not go back to his squadron to await the call. Upon graduation he was asked to stay on as an instructor. These men were seen as the most gifted of the gifted, the ultimate fighter pilots, the pure warriors.</div></li><li><div>There is no ER for Boyd’s time in the FWS, only a training report showing he completed the course. The best indication of how he performed is that upon graduation he was asked to stay on as an instructor—to become a high priest.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Six: Pope John Goes Severely Supersonic</div></li><ul><li><div>What he was teaching was how to think—not just of the maneuver, but of the effect each maneuver had on airspeed, what counter-moves were available to an enemy pilot, how to anticipate those counters, and how to keep enough airspeed to counter the counter-move. Airspeed preservation enabled a pilot to maintain or to regain the offensive. It was radical, heady stuff, the first effort ever to make air combat a science rather than an art.</div></li><li><div>But even more extraordinary is that the ER for Boyd, who still is a first lieutenant, is indorsed by a major general who says, “This young pilot has more get-up-and-go than any other 1st Lieutenant that I know.” The general ends by saying, “I recommend that consideration be given him to advance ahead of his contemporaries.” It is one of the best ERs of Boyd’s career.</div></li><li><div>In February 1957, he was promoted to captain and a few months later ordered to Maxwell Field at Montgomery, Alabama, for the four-month Squadron Officers School, a stepping-stone school for young career officers on the way up.</div></li><li><div>Over those years and many more, Spradling became “Mr. Fighter Weapons School,” the institutional memory, the one unchanging element in a school where officers came and went every few years. He was at Nellis twenty-two years and knew the great instructors and the great students, some of whom became heroes in Vietnam or rose to become generals. But for Vernon Spradling the memory of John Boyd burns brighter than that of anyone who passed through the school during those twenty-two years.</div></li><li><div>Some officers who knew Boyd during the Nellis years say he was obsessed. Others say he was “a little crazy.” Spradling might have agreed with both.</div></li><li><div>Spradling realized that Boyd did not want a conversation; Boyd simply wanted to talk. He talked to learn: as he went through his monologues, his thoughts bounced around, various theses were tried and rejected until finally he had gained a better understanding of whatever it was that was on his mind.</div></li><li><div>Curtis LeMay had boasted many times that no fighter could climb high enough or fast enough to reach his bombers. Then one day a B-47 pilot looked out the cockpit and watched a Hun driver do a barrel roll around his aircraft.&nbsp;<strong>The Hun ruled. And John Boyd was the best Hun driver in America.</strong></div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Slowly, sensing their level of skill and degree of confidence. If they wanted to learn, he taught them everything he knew. But occasionally there came a student with what Boyd called “an obstruction”—that is, one who thought he was a great pilot and needed no tutelage. Such a student needed to have the obstruction removed so he could fully understand the genius of the man teaching him.</div></li><li><div><strong>“The only way to get a fighter pilot’s attention is to whip his ass,” Boyd said.</strong></div></li><li><div>He used it to prove to students that no matter how good they thought they were, they could always learn. And he taught it as the “desperation maneuver” every fighter pilot should know when he is about to get hosed and there is no other option.</div></li><li><div>Then, too, most fighter pilots operate at the existing skill level. They never improve the state of their art and they never add anything to their profession. Boyd did both. And that rankles even more.</div></li><li><div><strong>Boyd fought countless air battles in the mid- and late 50s. He was never defeated. He was the champ, the title holder. Pope John, some called him. Others said he was the best fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force. And they were right.</strong></div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Seven: Rat-Racing</div></li><ul><li><div>Boyd became an Air Force legend not only for his flying, but for his abilities as a teacher.</div></li><li><div>How well a fighter pilot conducted the debrief was one of the most important criteria in evaluating that student as a possible instructor.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Eight: Forty-Second Boyd and the Tactics Manual</div></li><ul><li><div>“No one has ever gone through this school with a perfect academic record. I don’t know if you have the smarts to do that, Catton. But if you do, you will get their attention. If you don’t, you can forget your dream.”</div></li><ul><li><div>He would think about only one course at a time. And right now he was studying air combat maneuvering, Boyd’s course on aerial tactics. It was one of the toughest, designed to weed out every man who was not a tiger. For each hour spent in Boyd’s class, a student spent at least two hours studying. Catton settled in. He forgot his squadron mates. He forgot the Stag Bar. He got up at 2:30 A.M. and studied until breakfast. He studied between breakfast and class. He flew in the afternoon, had an early dinner, and studied late, then arose again at 2:30 to start all over again. He was a man possessed.</div></li><li><div>Boyd had enormous compassion for the underdog, having been one most of his life. When he saw the instructors and students at the FWS arrayed against Catton, he had to defend the young officer.</div></li><li><div><strong>He had an old-fashioned belief, instilled in him by Art Weibel and Frank Pettinato, that hard work can overcome all obstacles.</strong></div></li><li><div>He also knew that a few men, only the best, could grow up and blossom and realize their potential when they were put to the fire. Such men exemplify the highest qualities the FWS seeks to instill in its students. They not only deserve to wear the patch, they honor the patch.</div></li><li><div>Catton pushed through the crowd and walked down the hall toward Boyd’s office. He knocked on the door. “Enter.” The two men stared at each other. “I heard,” Boyd said. He smiled. “You cleaned them out.” Catton bit his lip and nodded. He could not speak. “Way to go, Tiger.” Catton turned away. A fighter pilot doesn’t cry, especially if he has just become the first fighter pilot in history to ace every academic course at the Fighter Weapons School. Catton graduated and was given a trophy for having the best academic record in his class. He was awarded the patch. Then he drove his red Corvette back across the desert to Cannon AFB in Clovis, New Mexico. A few months later he received the call.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Boyd then took an action that could have ended his career. He went over the colonel’s head and sent both the TR&amp;D manual and his manual to a friend at the Tactical Air Command headquarters, a man who could overrule Newman on what was used to teach tactics.</div></li><li><div>The angry colonel confronted Boyd and demanded to know why Boyd had gone over his head when he already had given his support to the TR&amp;D manual. But then word came down from TAC that Boyd’s work would be used as the official training manual at the FWS.</div></li><li><div>In his Oral History interview, Boyd recounts that he told Newman, “You ought to be glad. This way you are ending up with the better book. It is a better reflection on you as the commander.</div></li><li><div>In 1960 the “Aerial Attack Study” became the official tactics manual for fighter aircraft, and fighter aviation was no longer a bag of tricks to be passed down from one generation of pilots to another. For the first time the high-stakes game of aerial combat was documented, codified, and illustrated. While all other fighter pilots used their hands, Boyd used mathematics.</div></li><li><div>Before Boyd published the manual, fighter pilots thought the game of air-to-air combat was far too complex to ever fully understand. They believed the high-stakes death dance of aerial combat was too fluid to master. The “Aerial Attack Study” showed this was not the case.</div></li><li><div>When a pilot goes into an aerial battle, he must have a three-dimensional picture of the battle in his head. He must have “situation awareness”; that is, he must know not only where he and each of his squadron mates are located, but also where each enemy aircraft is located.</div></li><li><div>But situation awareness boils down to two things: first, the pilot must know the enemy’s position, and second, he must know the enemy’s velocity. (Boyd would later change “velocity” to “energy state.”) The amount of airspeed or velocity or energy available to the enemy dictates what that enemy is able to do, which maneuvers he can perform.</div></li><li><div>Everything a fighter pilot needed to know was in the “Aerial Attack Study.” The most prescient part was called “Basic Limitation of AIM-9 Against Maneuvering Targets.” Even though the Air Force had an unshakeable belief in the omnipotence of missiles, Boyd showed—and he was the first to do so—that missiles could be out-maneuvered by a maneuvering target (i.e., another fighter).</div></li><li><div>For the “Aerial Attack Study” Boyd received the Legion of Merit, an award usually given to senior officers. The commendation said the “Aerial Attack Study” was the “first instance in the history of fighter aviation in which tactics have been reduced to an objective state.” The commendation further stated that Boyd had demonstrated the maneuvers in a way that showed he was “undisputed master in the area of aerial combat.” Finally, the commendation said Boyd had assembled the manual “with a zeal seldom equaled” while performing his regular duties “in a superior manner.”</div></li><li><div>Foreign pilots training at Nellis as part of the Mutual Defense Assistance Pact took copies back to their countries, where it was studied as if it were Holy Writ. They agreed that the U.S. Air Force was truly an amazing organization if a mere captain could write such a document. Within ten years the “Aerial Attack Study” became the tactics manual for air forces around the world. It changed the way they flew and the way they fought. And it was written by a thirty-three-year-old captain who was not happy with it. Boyd believed the “Aerial Attack Study” could be formulated another way, that there had to be a better method of articulating the contents, maybe even something beyond the maneuver-countermaneuver strategy, something that went even beyond the mathematical formulae to the core, the very essence, of combat flying.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>Part Two: ENGINEER</div></li><ul><li><div>Chapter Nine: Thermo, Entropy, and the Breakthrough</div></li><ul><li><div>Boyd’s transcript from Georgia Tech shows his grades were erratic, ranging from A to D, with several dropped courses. But he doubled up enough in later quarters to receive his degree one quarter sooner than expected.</div></li><li><div>This was a war story, an instance of Boyd laying it on thick when talking to civilians—but this does not mean it was a lie, as most people define the word. Cooper as a southerner understood this. Southerners and fighter pilots know the story is more important than the facts. If a story is not true it can become true in the telling.</div></li><li><div>All entropy means, Cooper said, is that no system is one hundred percent effective; if it were, you would have a perpetual-motion machine. The professors make it too complicated with all the talk of unavailable energy and states of energy and systems.</div></li><li><div>Thermo laws about the conservation and dissipation of energy are like the tactical give-and-take of air-to-air combat. In a dogfight it is not power or airspeed that enables a pilot to outmaneuver an enemy. It is energy.</div></li><li><div>Boyd graduated from Georgia Tech after the summer quarter of 1962. Soon afterward he was promoted to major. All his promotions had been in or below the zone; that is, he had been promoted on schedule or faster. He was ahead of many of his contemporaries.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Ten: Ps=[T-D]V/W</div></li><ul><li><div>President John F. Kennedy had been profoundly influenced by Maxwell Taylor’s book The Uncertain Trumpet, in which Taylor asserted that the Massive Retaliation approach to war, the Eisenhower Doctrine, actually increased the possibility of conventional war.</div></li><li><div>In the middle of a conversation he suddenly would stop, pull out a scrap of paper, and scratch out an equation or a few notes. The more he talked, the more he understood about what he was trying to do. Each soliloquy was another step toward wherever it was he was going.</div></li><li><div>Boyd was metamorphosing from Forty-Second Boyd into the “Mad Major.”</div></li><li><div>While older and senior Air Force officers fumed at their failures, Christie quietly achieved his goals. His voice was so soft and his manner so self-effacing that few saw him as a potential rival. He was such a brilliant navigator of bureaucratic swamps that one of his nicknames was the “Finagler.” He could get anything done. And he could do it in such a gentle unobtrusive way that few ever became angry or jealous.</div></li><li><div>Boyd’s methods were the very antithesis of how Christie operated. And yet… there was something about him. Boyd was a man possessed. He had an idea bigger than himself—a cause. And that was what Christie wanted. A cause.</div></li><li><div>Rarely in the Air Force has an introduction resulted in such a productive, long-term, synergistic explosion of creative thought as when the Mad Major met the Finagler. The Air Force would never be the same. It was more than ambition and the desire to do good and significant work that bound these two men together. Neither man talked about personal or family matters, yet each must have sensed at some level the parallels in their childhoods: the embarrassing poverty, the dysfunctional families, the athletic prowess, the overpowering desire to get up and get out and to be somebody. Christie, though eight years younger than Boyd, would be more of an indulgent older brother.</div></li><li><div>Christie realized that Boyd had the ability to look at pages of numbers and visualize their meaning. He could look at what to most people would be a confusing jumble of arcane math and see an airplane with the variables of altitude, airspeed, temperature, angle of bank, and G-load. As Boyd sat at the table, his head moved and his shoulders rolled and his fist pulled back on the stick and he mumbled as he flew the numbers. He said to Christie, “The charts sing to me. I hear music when I read them.”</div></li><li><div>An airplane at a given altitude, given G, and given speed has a defined drag. The engine has a maximum potential thrust at that altitude and that temperature. If the engine puts out enough energy to match the drag, the aircraft’s total energy is unchanging—the energy rate is zero. All is balanced. But Boyd wanted to know how fast a pilot could gain energy when he fire walled the throttle. At a given altitude, given speed, and pulling a given amount of Gs, how much ooomph did he have in reserve?</div></li><li><div><strong>The E-M Theory, at its simplest, is a method to determine the specific energy rate of an aircraft. This is what every fighter pilot wants to know. If I am at 30,000 feet and 450 knots and pull six Gs, how fast am I gaining or losing energy? Can my adversary gain or lose energy faster than I can?</strong></div></li><li><div>If E-M could quantify aircraft performance, why couldn’t he back up the theory and use it to design fighter aircraft?</div></li><li><div>El Cid is a man of unbending principle and patriotism, and he sees duty as more important than family. Boyd lived by these same lights.</div></li><li><div>He must have been quite happy. The data from Wright-Pat would be along soon. Frank Pettinato was proud of him. He knew that Erie was talking about his buzzing the beach at the Peninsula. The poor boy in ragged clothes, the boy with no father, had grown up to be somebody. He was more than a salesman.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Eleven: The Sugarplum Fairy Spreads the Gospel</div></li><ul><li><div>His voice ranged from conversational to bombastic. When he made a point, he jutted his chin, paused, and stared. For a man who could be crude and coarse among his friends, he could, when giving a brief, be as smooth and professional as any officer in the Air Force. He spoke with fire and enthusiasm; he even spoke over the heads of those he was briefing. But he had such far-ranging knowledge of the new and fascinating subject that he could do this without antagonizing those in the audience.</div></li><li><div>Boyd and Christie became the first two men in the defense industry to talk about the limitations of missiles. When Boyd briefed fighter pilots, he taught techniques to defeat enemy missiles and to raise the Pk of U.S. missiles. And he told the pilots the best way to defeat surface-to-air missiles as well.</div></li><li><div>Boyd’s second ER at Eglin is dated September 7, 1964, and is nothing short of phenomenal. This is one of the few times in Air Force history, perhaps the only time, when an officer has created a radical new theory and then been told his job was to develop that theory.</div></li><li><div>The rating officer ends by saying of Boyd: “He is the most dedicated officer that I have known.”</div></li><li><div>Boyd no longer was a maintenance officer. He did as he had said; he had worked himself out of every job except developing E-M.</div></li><li><div>(Years later, when he was ambassador to Vietnam, Douglas Peterson said the pilots who flew E-M profiles for Boyd knew from the beginning this was not another busy-work project of the Air Force. He said everyone involved “sensed that this was breakthrough work that would ultimately impact on aircraft design and, as we saw immediately, on air-combat tactics.”)</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Twelve: Pull the Wings off and Paint It Yellow</div></li><ul><li><div>When Boyd was at his best—and he was at the top of his form that day—he was one of the best briefers in the Air Force.</div></li><li><div>The general controls the careers and lives of those on his staff. For an outsider to seize a day of the general’s time and to have the general’s undivided attention is seen by some on his staff as a threat. Several members of Sweeney’s staff began to ask questions designed to embarrass Boyd, to throw off his timing, to reveal how shallow this new theory was.</div></li><li><div>That was fine with Boyd. He looked on the questions as if they were bullets fired during an air-to-air engagement. Before more than a few words were out of a man’s mouth, Boyd knew where a question was going, and he knew how to respond. Like any fighter pilot he turned into the fight, confronting every question head-on.</div></li><li><div>The briefing was winding down, but Sweeney had one more question. “Major, yesterday you said you had run the numbers on all U.S. aircraft. But nowhere did you mention the F-111. Did your research cover that aircraft? If so, what conclusions did you draw?”</div></li><li><div>Boyd clicked the slide projector. His final slide was an E-M diagram of the F-111. Boyd did not speak. The general and his staff had seen enough E-M diagrams in the past two days to grasp the implications of the F-111 display. Even so, they studied the solid-red slide and then looked at Boyd in disbelief.</div></li><li><div>Boyd gave them the numbers that showed how at any altitude, any speed, any G-load, any part of the flight-performance envelope, the F-111 was inferior to the Soviet threat. If the F-111 faced a MiG, it would be shot down. Period. End of story. The F-111 was, in the traditional phrase of fighter pilots, a dog.</div></li><li><div>Sweeney’s acceptance of Boyd’s briefing meant E-M had the imprimatur of the Air Force high command. In the coming months Boyd briefed a series of four-stars, the USAF Scientific Advisory Board, and the secretary of the Air Force.</div></li><li><div>When he briefed the Air Force Science and Engineering Symposium, a convocation that lasted almost a week and included dozens of the best briefers in the Air Force, he was given the award for having the best presentation.</div></li><li><div>Boyd even briefed the president’s Scientific Advisory Board, the most respected and one of the most influential groups of scientists in America. It was an extraordinary streak of high-level briefings for anyone; for a major it was unprecedented.</div></li><li><div>When four MiGs attack four F-105s and the score is 2–0 in favor of the MiGs, people at the highest levels in the Pentagon want to know what the hell is going on. How can the U.S. Air Force so decisively lose an air-to-air engagement with MiGs? Was the problem with the pilots, the aircraft, or the tactics? Several months later four F-105s were lost in a single strike against a surface-to-air missile (SAM) site. Boyd and Christie were summoned to the Pentagon.</div></li><li><div>Boyd and Christie expanded the regular E-M brief to show how woefully inadequate were America’s air-to-air missiles, the Sparrow and the Sidewinder.</div></li><li><div>These were heady days for Boyd. His name was becoming known throughout the Air Force, and not just as a fighter pilot, but as a thinker, as a theoretician, as the man who developed a radical new theory. Even the Navy was using his E-M Theory. They took his name off it, and they did not call it E-M, but it was Boyd’s work. Given the success of E-M, Boyd had been invited to be part of the group whose job it was to develop a design for the new fighter the Air Force wanted to build.&nbsp;<strong>He had hosed another one.</strong></div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Boyd did not see the dangers inherent in deliberately seeking conflict with others. In his mind he had been wronged by the civilian. The fact he had briefed top people in the Air Force and in government proved he had been right and the civilian wrong. But to be right was not enough. He had to have a redress of grievances and he had to publicly embarrass the person who wronged him. He had to be the last man standing. “People did things to me when we were young,” he once told Mary. “They did it because we were poor. But they’re not going to do it now.”</div></li><li><div>Often, when a man is young and idealistic, he believes that if he works hard and does the right thing, success will follow. This was what Boyd’s mother and childhood mentors had told him. But hard work and success do not always go together in the military, where success is defined by rank, and reaching higher rank requires conforming to the military’s value system. Those who do not conform will one day realize that the path of doing the right thing has diverged from the path of success, and then they must decide which path they will follow through life.</div></li><li><div>Boyd was awarded the Air Force Systems Command Scientific Achievement Award, the highest scientific award in the AFSC. Then he was awarded the Air Force Research and Development Award for Aeronautical Engineering, the highest scientific award the Air Force gives to an officer.</div></li><li><div>Boyd had established a pattern: no matter what his contributions to the Air Force or to national defense might be—and there were significant contributions yet to come—his outspoken nature, his lack of reluctance to criticize his superiors, and his love of conflict with others would hinder his promotion throughout his career.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Thirteen: “I’ve Never Designed a Fighter Plane Before”</div></li><ul><li><div><strong>If an officer is to be promoted rapidly, he must have a protector, a guardian, a rabbi—what the Navy calls a “sea daddy”—to prepare the way.</strong> No better protector can be found than a man with stars on his shoulders. A general who bestows his blessings on a young officer can see that the officer receives assignments that prepare him for ever-higher commands. A general’s support automatically puts an officer’s career on the fast track.</div></li><li><div>All the things that make the Pentagon so prized by careerists make it loathed and detested by warriors. The self-promotion and sycophancy and backstabbing treachery are all anathema to a warrior. A warrior wants his country to be prepared for war, to win against all enemies, to prevail at all costs. Duty and patriotism and honor are not buzz words to a warrior; they are his creed. A warrior speaks the truth to generals and congressmen. Being promoted is not the top priority of a warrior. Thus, warriors do not fare well in the Pentagon.</div></li><li><div>Boyd also was about to demonstrate how he rarely met a general he couldn’t offend.</div></li><li><div>The host of troubles facing the Air Force allowed Boyd to take over the F-X project. His takeover was de facto rather than de jure, as he was far junior in rank to people who made design and acquisition decisions and to those who, on organization charts, led the F-X program.</div></li><li><div>if one knows which decisions about the F-X were crucial and who made those decisions, one sees that Boyd was driving the train that would deliver the F-X. He knew more about fighter tactics and what made a great fighter aircraft than any man in the Air Force.</div></li><li><div>Boyd had support from the top, invaluable in a bureaucracy. Few in the Building knew that Air Force Chief of Staff John McConnell was a Boyd fan. It was General McConnell who cancelled Boyd’s Vietnam tour and brought him to the Pentagon. He knew of Boyd, the legend: fighter pilot and creator of the E-M Theory. But he needed Boyd, the maverick: the obstreperous and independent officer who cared more for his work than for his career. Only such a man could save the F-X from being cancelled and prevent the Air Force from being outmaneuvered by the Navy.</div></li><li><div>A fighter is designed one way, a low-level nuclear bomber another, and an all-weather interdiction bomber still another. Put all these requirements inside the skin of one airplane and all you get is trouble.</div></li><li><div>Everything prepared by generals and bureaucrats at Wright-Pat, everything from the generals of the Tactical Air Command and the Systems Command and their staffs—it all had to go. The Air Force simply was going about this the wrong way. As Boyd later explained, <strong>“You gotta challenge all assumptions. If you don’t, what is doctrine on day one becomes dogma forever after.”</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Boyd did not care about Bigger-Higher-Faster-Farther. He wanted only one thing: a fighter that would dominate the skies for decades.</strong></div></li><li><div>Boyd was fascinated by Sprey’s knowledge of math and statistics. Sprey could help him hone the E-M Theory into a tool for designing the finest fighter aircraft the world had ever known. And Sprey was excited by Boyd’s profound ideas about fighter combat and by his intellect and rectitude. He had finally met an Air Force officer of fire and conviction. Sprey was not the sort of man who followed other men, but he could follow Boyd. Boyd had met the second of the Acolytes.</div></li><li><div>The F-X now became as much a part of Sprey’s life as it was Boyd’s. After most people departed the Building, Boyd and Sprey were still at their desks. And then around 7:00 or 8:00 P.M., Boyd wandered down to Sprey’s office. In the beginning they met maybe once a week, then twice, then three and four nights. The men pored over E-M charts for the F-X, new designs, and arcane engineering data until long after midnight.</div></li><li><div>Sprey realized, as had Christie before him, that being Boyd’s friend meant dedicating one’s life to Boyd’s causes. Very few men were ever invited by Boyd to join forces with him. None ever refused. Each sensed intuitively that he was being offered a rare gift. Each was to pay a terrible price for his friendship with Boyd. Each would have paid more.</div></li><li><div>Boyd and Sprey formed the nucleus of what in a few years would be the most famous, most detested, and most reluctantly respected ad hoc group in the Building, a group that history would know as the “Fighter Mafia.”</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Fourteen: Bigger-Higher-Faster-Farther</div></li><ul><li><div>One night Christie’s phone rang and he knew it was Boyd. He looked at his watch. The hour was late, and Boyd was so intense that Christie knew if he picked up the phone that he would be held captive for hours. So he did not answer. He and his wife, Kathy, sat and talked and read and shook their heads in wonderment as the phone rang for thirty-two minutes before Boyd gave up.</div></li><li><div>Boyd was guided in his work by one simple principle: he wanted to give pilots a fighter that would outmaneuver any enemy. He did not become fixated on technology or “one-point” numerical solutions.</div></li><li><div>When generals complained about Boyd’s language, he said he did not mean to sound disrespectful. “I’m just a dumb fighter pilot. I don’t know any better. I had an IQ test in high school and they gave me a ninety.” For several months Boyd was not allowed to brief generals and members of Congress. But the Air Force had to have the F-X and no one else preached the gospel as convincingly as Boyd. Soon he was back-briefing VIPs. And his language was the same.</div></li><li><div>Trade-offs are the heart and soul of aircraft design. If an engineer wanted greater range, he knew acceleration would be diminished. If he wanted greater speed, the wings would have to be smaller, and that, in turn, would decrease turning ability. If he wanted a small airplane, the engine, wings, or range would shrink. All things have to be wrapped inside the skin of a fighter. Design discipline is the key.</div></li><li><div>“If Major Boyd were evaluated solely on technical competence, he would be rated absolutely superior.” This sounds complimentary. But the ER of a major being considered for promotion should not talk about technical competence; rather it should talk about his ability to lead, to obtain the maximum work from his subordinates, to show a potential for higher rank and greater responsibilities. Talking about a major’s technical competence is a signal to the promotion board that this officer is not qualified for further advancement.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Fifteen: Saving the F-15</div></li><ul><li><div>Boyd was constantly angry about what he saw as careerism and corruption, and he brought the anger home.</div></li><li><div>All the children say today that their anger toward their father is rooted in his insistence on living in the tiny apartment.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Boyd won battles not only in the open and more or less public arenas, such as briefings, but also in the corridors and offices of the Pentagon, where politics is both byzantine and deadly. Here, one of his greatest weapons was his secret back-channel communication to the Air Force chief of staff. The chief often followed the Franklin Roosevelt theory of management, bypassing sycophantic generals and seeking out from among relatively junior officers a few men who would tell him the truth.</div></li><li><div>“Sir, I’ll be happy to follow that order. But I want you to put it in writing.” Generals like to issue verbal orders. That way if the results are not what the general expected, he can always deny he issued the order. While Boyd was within his rights to ask for written orders, his doing so infuriated generals. It clearly indicated he thought the general was wrong.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><li><div>Chapter Seventeen: The Fighter Mafia Does the Lord’s Work</div></li><ul><li><div>Reduced to its basics, the Grand Strategy was to take on the U.S. Air Force, develop the new lightweight fighter in secret, build a prototype, then force the Air Force to adopt the aircraft.</div></li><li><div>He told Sprey and Riccioni they should never make a reference, on the phone or even in private conversation, to the fighter they were designing. Anything and everything to do with the lightweight fighter should be referred to as the “Lord’s work.”</div></li><li><div>During the previous year he received two awards that brought credit on the Air Force “in a manner rare for an officer of his rank and experience.” From a nationwide pool of candidates, he won the 1970 Hoyt S. Vandenberg Award for “outstanding contributions to aerospace technology.” The ER said Boyd was “one of the best minds in the Air Force.” He won a Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf cluster for his advanced E-M Theory, which the reviewing officer said “constitutes the most powerful evaluative tool for fighter aircraft analysis known to date and has provided industry with one of the most effective tools generated in the history of aeronautical engineering.” The review ended with: “Definitely promote below-the-zone to Colonel—now.”</div></li><li><div>Boyd went to him and said, “If you insist on getting credit for the work you do, you’ll never get far in life. Don’t confuse yourself with the idea of getting credit.”</div></li><li><div>John Boyd had contributed as much to fighter tactics, aeronautical engineering, science, the Air Force, and his country as any man in Air Force history. A list of Air Force original thinkers—and this is a short list—would begin with his name. But his enemies prevailed. He had shot down too many generals ever to become a general.</div></li><li><div>He remembered the F-86’s countless battles with MiGs. He remembered how, on paper, the MiG was a superior aircraft in almost every respect. But the F-86 had a ten-to-one kill ratio against the MiG. Why?</div></li><ul><li><div>Boyd pored over the notes again and again. Could there be something else, some other element, perhaps an element not covered by E-M, that held the answer?</div></li><li><div>First, the F-86 had a bubble canopy that gave the pilot a 360-degree field of vision, while the MiG pilot’s view to the rear was blocked. Thus, the F-86 pilot had a much easier time observing his enemy than the enemy had observing him.</div></li><li><div>Second, the F-86 had full hydraulic controls, while the MiG did not. This meant that the F-86 pilot could control his aircraft with one finger,</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>Chapter Eighteen: A Short-Legged Bird</div></li><ul><li><div>The cost of developing a new fighter rose to around $1 billion.</div></li><li><div>The biggest secret, the single most innovative and startling aspect of the design, was that the new fighter would have greater range than the F-15. Sprey and Boyd fought for months over this. Sprey, ever the purist, wanted less fuel. Less fuel means less weight and less weight means better performance. Boyd, as always, had planned move and countermove, and he saw a way to have enough fuel to beat the F-15 in range.</div></li><li><div>The fuel fraction is derived by considering the weight of the fuel relative to the combat weight of the aircraft. The crucial thing about understanding fuel fraction is that it is the relative fuel and not the absolute fuel that is important in determining how far an airplane flies. That is, the percentage of fuel relative to the weight of the aircraft is more important than the absolute gallons of fuel carried. Boyd was adamant that the fuel fraction for the lightweight fighter not go below 30 percent.</div></li><li><div>It would be several years before the Air Force realized that the lightweight fighter not only had greater range than the F-15 but had greater range than any other fighter in the Air Force. That knowledge would cause more than a dozen generals to explode in anger. Keeping secret the range of the lightweight fighter was one of Boyd’s greatest cape jobs.</div></li><li><div><strong>Boyd’s E-M Theory so shaped the F-15 that many were calling him the “Father of the F-15.”</strong></div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Nineteen: Spook Base</div></li><ul><li><div>John Boyd came to NKP as the vice commander of Task Force Alpha.</div></li><li><div>The letter of evaluation said Boyd “has a seemingly unlimited ability and stamina to effectively cope with stressed operational procedures.” He “prevented a possible major problem” by “exercising unusually sound judgment” in a racially charged situation. But most important of all it said, “He is fully qualified for Command.”</div></li><li><div>Boyd was pulled out of Task Force Alpha and given command of the 56th Combat Support Group, a job that included, among other things, being base commander.</div></li><li><div>E-M is at heart such a simple thing; why had no one else discovered it? What was there about his thinking that enabled him to be the first?</div></li><li><div>The indorsing officer, a major general, says Boyd’s performance was “absolutely superior” and that “Colonel Boyd is a highly intelligent and dedicated officer who generates enthusiasm and instills confidence in those with whom he works and supervises.”</div></li><li><div>It was as base commander, a job that made Boyd master of all he surveyed, that his creative flair for solving problems soon burst into bloom. Boyd was responsible for all civil-engineering projects on base, transportation, security, and just about everything else, from supervising the dining rooms to making sure religious services were available for all.</div></li><li><div>7th Air Force sent down paperwork daily that took hours to answer. Boyd thought Air Force bureaucracy was keeping him from the job at hand. His solution was to respond but to add material that caused 7th Air Force more paperwork than 7th Air Force caused him. “Pain goes both ways,” he said. In only a few weeks the time-consuming requests from 7th Air Force shrank to almost nothing.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Twenty: Take a Look at the B-I</div></li><ul><li><div>Hallock sat down with Schlesinger and said in effect, “You must understand that if you want to leave a legacy it is vital for you to make a quick decision about what you want that legacy to be. If you don’t make a quick decision, you will have no legacy. Because after several months you become so caught up in the business of the Pentagon, so enmeshed with the generals, so overwhelmed with the scope and enormity of the job that it will be too late. Pick a few projects and put the full weight of your office behind them. Guide the projects. Nurture them. Know from the very beginning that they will be your legacy. Force them through the bureaucracy.”</div></li><li><div>Boyd’s new job in the Building was director of the Office of Development Plans. This office was one of several that conducted long-range planning for the Air Force, but in truth it was a dumping ground: the Air Force placed so little importance on long-range planning that the office never had developed a systematic approach. In yet another sign that Boyd would not make general, the Air Force had stashed him on a dead-end street. But Boyd was about to use the job as a platform from which he would rock the foundations of the Pentagon.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>“Tiger, one day you will come to a fork in the road,” he said. “And you’re going to have to make a decision about which direction you want to go.” He raised his hand and pointed. “If you go that way you can be somebody. You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends. But you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted and you will get good assignments.” Then Boyd raised his other hand and pointed another direction. “Or you can go that way and you can do something—something for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself. If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won’t have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference.” He paused and stared into Leopold’s eyes and heart. “To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision. To be or to do? Which way will you go?”</strong></div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Twenty-One: “This Briefing is for Information Purposes Only”</div></li><ul><li><div>Now they were all together, all save one: Christie the Finagler, Sprey the Intelligent, Leopold the First, Spinney the Brash, and Burton the Unbending.</div></li><li><div>It is the nature of a careerist to mold and fit himself to his commanding officer. So Burton resolved to adjust. He would try to understand Boyd and he would begin by using Leopold and Spinney as interpreters. “What does he mean by that?” became a frequent question. Or “Why is he doing that?”</div></li><li><div>Boyd finished a six-and-one-half-page draft of the Development Planning Report. It is significant in two respects. First, astonishingly, it marks the first time the Air Force ever had guidelines about matching planning needs with available budgets. Second, the report says if combat tasks are to be of any use to planners, the tasks should be related to needed hardware.</div></li><li><div>What Spinney remembers most about the B-1 episode is his call to Boyd to tell him what happened at the briefing. When Boyd heard that the three-star had used Spinney’s charts over the strong objections of the two-star, he was exultant.</div></li><li><div>“My captain fucked a two-star?” he roared. And then he laughed and said, “Way to go, Tiger.”</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Twenty-Two: The Buttonhook Turn</div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Sprad had found that it was almost impossible for Boyd to finish the “Aerial Attack Study” and Christie discovered the same thing with the E-M Theory. Boyd never wanted to finish an intellectual effort. He made changes and those changes made him see another fallacy or another place for elaboration, and the process began all over.</div></li><li><div>Burton wrote later that Boyd said to him, “Your friend is not a friend. He used you.” Burton knew that Boyd was right.</div></li><li><div>Seeing it all on the blackboard made clear to Burton what Boyd and Spinney and Leopold had seen months earlier. And from that moment on, Burton had a new rule: judge people by what they do and not what they say they will do.</div></li><li><div>On June 25, 1975, Boyd won the Harold Brown Award, the highest scientific award granted by the Air Force.</div></li><li><div>While he performed brilliantly as a commander at NKP, that was a wartime environment. He was a natural leader, but he did not have the sort of management skills the Air Force looked for when they promoted colonels.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>Part Three: SCHOLAR</div></li><ul><li><div>Chapter Twenty-Three: Destruction and Creation</div></li><ul><li><div><strong>There was little soul-searching among senior generals. They were managers rather than warriors. And when managers lead an army it is their nature to cast blame rather than to accept responsibility.</strong></div></li><li><div>Boyd knew he had to be independent and he saw only two ways for a man to do this: he can either achieve great wealth or reduce his needs to zero. Boyd said if a man can reduce his needs to zero, he is truly free: there is nothing that can be taken from him and nothing anyone can do to hurt him.</div></li><li><div>When Boyd had drained Christie, he called one of the other Acolytes and went through the same process. All of these men were well educated and widely read. But by the end of 1975 and certainly by the early months of 1976, the depth of Boyd’s study was moving beyond what any of them experienced in graduate school. Boyd was charging into esoteric and arcane areas of knowledge. And the Acolytes were far too proud to simply agree with Boyd on everything he said. If they were going to hold up their end of the conversation they had to buy whatever book Boyd was reading. They read and when Boyd called they were ready.</div></li><li><div>“If you want to understand something, take it to the extremes or examine its opposites,” Boyd said. He practiced what he preached. He considered every word and every idea from every possible angle, then threw it out for discussion, argued endless hours, restructured his line of thought, and threw it out for discussion again. Creativity was painful and laborious and repetitive and detail-haunted—not just to him, but to a half-dozen people around him.</div></li><li><div><strong>The most important part of “Destruction and Creation” is Boyd’s elaboration on the idea that a relationship exists between an observer and what is being observed.</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>A half-dozen people can look at the same process or the same event and each might see the process or the event in an entirely different fashion.</strong></div></li><li><div>Atop this insight Boyd placed an idea borrowed from Heisenberg: <strong>the process of observation changes what is being observed</strong>. To continue with the simplified example, people in the crowd, knowing they are being observed by a television cameraman, might wave or shout or begin spontaneous demonstrations.</div></li><li><div>If we are aware that these changes take place we reassess and recalculate our relationship with whatever it is we are observing. In other words, the process not only shapes what is being observed but feedback reshapes the observer’s outlook.</div></li><li><div><strong>Boyd said there are two ways to manipulate information gleaned from observation: analysis and synthesis. </strong></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>We can analyze whatever process or event we are observing by breaking it down into individual components and interactions. And from this we can make deductions that lead to understanding. </strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Or we can synthesize by taking various sometimes unrelated components and putting them together to form a new whole.</strong></div></li></ul><li><div><strong>Boyd thought analysis could lead to understanding but not to creativity. Taken to the extreme, he thought analysis was an onanistic activity, gratifying only to the person doing the analyzing.</strong></div></li><ul><li><div>“Imagine four separate images. Let’s call them domains. Each domain can be easily understood by looking at its parts and at the relation among the parts.”</div></li><li><div>The separate ingredients make sense when collected under the respective headings. But then Boyd shattered the relationship between the parts and their respective domains. He took the ingredients in the web of relationships and asked listeners to visualize them scattered at random. He called breaking the domains apart a “destructive deduction.”</div></li><li><div>The deduction was destructive in that the relationship between the parts and the whole was destroyed. Uncertainty and disorder took the place of meaning and order.</div></li><li><div>Then he challenged the audience: “How do we construct order and meaning out of this mess?”</div></li></ul><li><div><strong>Boyd showed how synthesis was the basis of creativity. </strong></div></li><ul><li><div>He asked, “From some of the ingredients in this sea of anarchy, how do we find common qualities and connecting threads to synthesize a new and altogether different domain?”</div></li></ul><li><div>To make sure the new reality is both viable and relevant, Boyd said it must be continually refined by verifying its internal consistency and by making sure it matches up with reality. But the very process of making sure the reality is relevant causes mismatches between the new observation and the description of that observation. It is here that Godel, Heisenberg, and the second law come into play. The mismatches are inevitable and expected because, as Boyd said, “<strong>One cannot determine the character or nature of a system within itself. Moreover, attempts to do so lead to confusion and disorder.</strong>” This never-ending cycle of mismatches, destruction, and creation is the “natural manifestation of a dialectic engine.” This “engine” is the relationship between the observer and whatever is being observed. <strong>The idea that a two-way relationship exists between the observer and the observed, that the process of observation changes what is being observed, and that our awareness of these changes causes us to restructure the relationship is present in subtle and often unseen ways in almost every facet of our lives. It is a vital part of how we cope with our world; it shapes our decisions and actions.</strong> The danger—and this is a danger neither seen nor understood by many people who profess a knowledge of Boyd’s work—is that <strong>if our mental processes become focused on our internal dogmas and isolated from the unfolding, constantly dynamic outside world, we experience mismatches between our mental images and reality. Then confusion and disorder and uncertainty not only result but continue to increase. Ultimately, as disorder increases, chaos can result.</strong> Boyd showed why this is a natural process and why the only alternative is to do a destructive deduction and rebuild one’s mental image to correspond to the new reality.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Twenty-Four: OODA Loop</div></li><ul><li><div>The fast transients brief is dated August 4, 1976. It is the application of “Destruction and Creation” to an operational issue—that is, a better and more thorough definition of “maneuverability.” The ability of an aircraft to perform fast transients does two things, one defensive and one offensive: it can force an attacking aircraft out of a favorable firing position, and it can enable a pursuing pilot to gain a favorable firing position.</div></li><li><div>The advantage gained from the fast transient suggests that to win in battle a pilot needs to operate at a faster tempo than his enemy. It suggests that he must stay one or two steps ahead of his adversary; he must operate inside his adversary’s time scale.</div></li><li><div><strong>Thinking about operating at a quicker tempo—not just moving faster—than the adversary was a new concept in waging war.</strong> <strong>Generating a rapidly changing environment—that is, engaging in activity that is so quick it is disorienting and appears uncertain or ambiguous to the enemy—inhibits the adversary’s ability to adapt and causes confusion and disorder that, in turn, causes an adversary to overreact or underreact. Boyd closed the briefing by saying the message is that whoever can handle the quickest rate of change is the one who survives.</strong></div></li><li><div>In the beginning Boyd took an hour to deliver “Patterns.” A decade later, when Boyd put all his work into a collection titled “A Discourse on Winning and Losing,” he took about fourteen hours—two days—to deliver it.</div></li><li><div>As with much of Boyd’s work, the building blocks for “Patterns” are mostly well-known ideas. But the synthesis of these ideas produced a reality new to the U.S. military. “Patterns” is one of the most monumental snowmobiles ever constructed, one of the most influential briefings ever to come from a military mind.</div></li><li><div>Sun Tzu’s ideas about conflict include such themes as deception, speed, fluidity of action, surprise, and shaping the adversary’s perception of the world. Sun Tzu also talked of how a commander should use two thrusts, either of which could attain the objective.</div></li><li><div><strong>The most significant element in Sun Tzu is the concept of cheng and ch’i, the orthodox and the unorthodox, the traditional and the unexpected.</strong></div></li><li><div>The Art of War became Boyd’s Rosetta stone, the work he returned to again and again. It is the only theoretical book on war that Boyd did not find fundamentally flawed. He eventually owned seven translations, each with long passages underlined and with copious marginalia. The translations of Samuel Griffith and, later, Thomas Cleary were his favorites.</div></li><li><div>Boyd found many such instances in history, and in these victories by numerically inferior forces he found a common thread: none of the victorious commanders threw their forces head-to-head against enemy forces. They usually did not fight what is known as a “war of attrition.” Rather, they used deception, speed, fluidity of action, and strength against weakness.</div></li><li><div>He began reading passages and explaining two crucial differences between von Clausewitz and Sun Tzu. First, von Clausewitz wants to bring the enemy to a big “decisive battle,” while Sun Tzu wants to unravel the enemy before a battle. Put another way, von Clausewitz believes wars are decided by set piece battles more than by strategy, deception, and guerrillalike tactics. This means that even if he wins, there is a bloodbath. Boyd said von Clausewitz’s second major flaw is that he spends a lot of time talking about how a commander must minimize “friction”—that is, the uncertainty or chance that always appear in the “fog of war.” He does not deal with maximizing the enemy’s friction—as does Sun Tzu—but only with minimizing his own.</div></li><li><div>Journalists called it the “Blitzkrieg.” The Germans bypassed enemy strong points—such as the Maginot Line—and, with the use of airplanes and radio communications, punched through enemy weaknesses following the path of least resistance, driving deep into the enemy’s rear, cutting lines of communication, disrupting movement, and paralyzing the enemy’s command and control system. They moved so fast the enemy simply could not understand what was happening and became unglued.</div></li><li><div><strong>Boyd, borrowing from Sun Tzu, said the best commander is the one who wins while avoiding battle. The intent is to shatter cohesion, produce paralysis, and bring about collapse of the adversary by generating confusion, disorder, panic, and chaos.</strong> Boyd said war is organic and compared his technique to clipping the nerves, muscles, and tendons of an enemy, thus reducing him to jelly.</div></li><li><div><strong>Schwerpunkt means the main focus of effort. On a deeper reading it is the underlying goal, the glue that holds together various units.</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Fingerspitzengefuhl means a fingertip feel. Again, the fuller meaning applies to a leader’s instinctive and intuitive sense of what is going on or what is needed in a battle or, for that matter, in any conflict.</strong></div></li><li><div>OODA Loop. The key thing to understand about Boyd’s version is not the mechanical cycle itself, but rather the need to execute the cycle in such fashion as to get inside the mind and the decision cycle of the adversary. This means the adversary is dealing with outdated or irrelevant information and thus becomes confused and disoriented and can’t function.</div></li><li><div>Becoming oriented to a competitive situation means bringing to bear the cultural traditions, genetic heritage, new information, previous experiences, and analysis / synthesis process of the person doing the orienting—a complex integration that each person does differently. These human differences make the Loop unpredictable. In addition, the orientation phase is a nonlinear feedback system, which, by its very nature, means this is a pathway into the unknown. The unpredictability is crucial to the success of the OODA Loop.</div></li><li><div><strong>When one has developed the proper Fingerspitzengefuhl for a changing situation, the tempo picks up and it seems one is then able to bypass the explicit “Orientation” and “Decision” part of the loop, to “Observe” and “Act” almost simultaneously. The speed must come from a deep intuitive understanding of one’s relationship to the rapidly changing environment. This is what enables a commander seemingly to bypass parts of the loop.</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Understanding the OODA Loop enables a commander to compress time—that is, the time between observing a situation and taking an action. A commander can use this temporal discrepancy (a form of fast transient) to select the least-expected action rather than what is predicted to be the most-effective action. The enemy can also figure out what might be the most effective. To take the least-expected action disorients the enemy. It causes him to pause, to wonder, to question. This means that as the commander compresses his own time, he causes time to be stretched out for his opponent. The enemy falls farther and farther behind in making relevant decisions. It hastens the unraveling process.</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Boyd says that to shape the environment, one must manifest four qualities: variety, rapidity, harmony, and initiative. A commander must have a series of responses that can be applied rapidly; he must harmonize his efforts and never be passive.</strong></div></li><li><div>Another important slide shows how the Blitzkrieg—or maneuver conflict—is the perfect tactical application of the OODA Loop. Boyd asks: How does a commander harmonize the numerous individual thrusts of a Blitzkrieg attack and maintain the cohesion of his larger effort? The answer is that <strong>the Blitzkrieg is far more than the lightning thrusts that most people think of when they hear the term; rather it was all about high operational tempo and the rapid exploitation of opportunity.</strong></div></li><ul><li><div>In a Blitzkrieg situation, the commander is able to maintain a high operational tempo and rapidly exploit opportunity because he makes sure his subordinates know his intent, his Schwerpunkt. They are not micromanaged, that is, they are not told to seize and hold a certain hill; instead they are given “mission orders.” This means that they understand their commander’s overall intent and they know their job is to do whatever is necessary to fulfill that intent. The subordinate and the commander share a common outlook. They trust each other, and this trust is the glue that holds the apparently formless effort together. Trust emphasizes implicit over explicit communications. Trust is the unifying concept. This gives the subordinate great freedom of action. Trust is an example of a moral force that helps bind groups together in what Boyd called an “organic whole.”</div></li></ul><li><div><strong>Boyd, like Sun Tzu and Napoléon, believed in attacking with “moral conflict”—that is, using actions that increase menace, uncertainty, and mistrust in the enemy while increasing initiative, adaptability, and harmony within friendly forces.</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Boyd showed that maneuver tactics brought victory. To attack the mind of the opponent, to unravel the commander before a battle even begins, is the essence of fighting smart.</strong></div></li><li><div>A crucial part of the OODA Loop—or “Boyd Cycle,” as it has come to be known—is that once the process begins, it must not slow. It must continue and it must accelerate.</div></li><li><div><strong>Boyd begins the section on maneuver conflict with two crucial words: “Ambiguity, deception…”—the essence of maneuver tactics.</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>The key to victory is operating at a quicker tempo than the enemy.</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>The theme of this section is consistent: disorient the enemy, then follow with the unexpected lightning thrust.</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>If the briefing could be reduced to two simple thoughts, they would be: 1) the essence of warfare is cheng and ch’i, and 2) to practice this most effectively a commander must operate at a faster OODA Loop than does his opponent.</strong></div></li><li><div>Boyd dove deeper and deeper into the study of war. He realized that while wars take place between nations, every person experiences some form of war; conflict is a fundamental part of human nature. <strong>To prevail in personal and business relations, and especially war, we must understand what takes place in a person’s mind.</strong></div></li><li><div>When Spinney arrived, Christie said, “Do you want to work for me in TacAir? You’ll be working with Boyd.” That was all Spinney needed to hear. To work with Boyd meant conflict with the Pentagon, and Spinney was born for conflict. He remembered what Boyd often said: “There are only so many ulcers in the world and it is your job to see that other people get them.” Spinney said yes on the spot.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Twenty-Five: Reform</div></li><ul><li><div>Spinney made no recommendations in his brief, so he was said to be a nihilist, a destroyer. But the omission was deliberate. Spinney knew that if he followed the usual procedure and included a list of recommendations, the focus would shift from the problem to which chores would go to what agency. He wanted the focus to remain on the problem.</div></li><li><div>One of Boyd’s fundamental dictums when waging bureaucratic war was to use the other person’s information against him. Spinney’s brief was built on Pentagon documents. He understated everything so that any revisions would only make his conclusions more damning.</div></li><li><div>(Boyd’s belief in using the adversary’s information against him is the practical application of Asian writings, particularly The Japanese Art of War, in which translator Thomas Cleary talks of “swordlessness,” or the ability to defend oneself without a weapon, a concept that by implication means using the enemy’s weapon against him. Cleary says this technique can be used in debate, negotiations, and all other forms of competition.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Twenty-Six: The Great Wheel of Conspiracy</div></li><ul><li><div>No one could counter Boyd’s briefing because no one in the Building was doing similar work; the Pentagon had no military theorists.</div></li><li><div>By now, some of the ideas in Boyd’s briefing, particularly the OODA Loop, were popping up in various publications, often without crediting him. Boyd never seemed to care. He was a true guerrilla in that he only wanted his ideas to find acceptance.</div></li><li><div>Boyd knew that when Pentagon bureaucrats seek vengeance the best strategy is not—as many believe—to keep a low profile but rather to become so prominent that any retribution will be seen for what it is.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Twenty-Seven: Boyd Joins the Marines</div></li><ul><li><div>Synchronization is evening up the front line; it means an Army moves at the speed of its slowest unit. Synchronization is a fundamental part of the old doctrine of attrition warfare, and it obviates all the other changes. An army that relies on synchronization is not an army that practices maneuver warfare.</div></li><li><div>The Army not only adopted most of Boyd’s theories regarding maneuver warfare, they even created the School of Advanced Military Studies—SAMS,</div></li><li><div>The U.S. Marine Corps is a separate and distinct culture within the military. Marines are considered both primitive and elitist—primitive because all Marines are basically infantrymen, and elitist because they are so few in number and so good at what they do.</div></li><li><div>Other services recruit by making promises. The Marines recruit by looking for a few good men.</div></li><li><div>No part of the U.S. military, however, has more esprit de corps, more respect for the military way, and more reverence for the individual than the Marine Corps. The Marine creed of Semper Fidelis—always faithful—is a living breathing thing. When a Marine agrees to do something, looks someone in the eye and says, “Semper Fi,” you know he will do what he promised.</div></li><li><div>Marines in Delta Company knew how to disperse and how to use guerrilla tactics—how to fight like the enemy. Wyly remembered the lessons of Pendleton and saw how those lessons made sense. He sent out saturation patrols. His Marines were in the bush all the time. He kept the enemy off balance; they knew Delta Company could show up anywhere, anytime.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Twenty-Eight: Semper Fi</div></li><ul><li><div>Boyd and Wyly decided the AWS was fundamentally an educational institution, and educational institutions are places where students consider all ideas. One of the best ways to do that is to have students read. So Wyly and Boyd put together a reading list.</div></li><li><div>Once, while the groups wrestled with how to put a landing force on the shores of Iran, Boyd realized the Marines were placing inordinate emphasis on how to establish a beachhead. <strong>“That beachhead is looming bigger and bigger,” he said. “You guys are paying too much attention to terrain. The focus should be on the enemy. Fight the enemy, not the terrain.”</strong></div></li><li><div>Boyd’s teaching methods were different from those of a university. He abhorred guidelines or lists or rules or deductive thinking; everything was intuitive. “You must have inductive thinking,” he said again and again to the Marines. “There is not just one solution to a problem,” he said. “There are two or three or five ways to solve a problem. Never commit to a single solution.”</div></li><li><div>The military believes most of all in hardware. But Boyd said, “<strong>People should come first. Then ideas. And then hardware.</strong>”</div></li><li><div>Wyly was leading a guerrilla movement within the Corps, and sometimes he recalled a line from his lectures:<strong> “Guerrillas win wars but they don’t march home to victory parades.”</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Boyd said, “Do not write it as a formula. Write it as a way to teach officers to think, to think in new ways about war. War is ever changing and men are ever fallible. Rigid rules simply won’t work. Teach men to think.” Boyd paused a moment and added a final thought. “And keep the goddamn thing simple so generals can understand it.”</strong></div></li><li><div>It was also a matter of considerable pride to Wyly that during the 1980s the Marine Corps evolved from being knuckle draggers who take the hill to the most intellectual branch of the U.S. military; even enlisted men were reading Sun Tzu.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Twenty-Nine: Water-Walker</div></li><ul><li><div>Because he had no father, he did not know how to be a father. But because of Art Weibel and Frank Pettinato he did know how to be a mentor.</div></li><li><div>Civilians unacquainted with the ways of the Building have only vague ideas about what it is the Pentagon does. They think the real business of the Pentagon has something to do with defending America. But it does not. The real business of the Pentagon is buying weapons. And the military has a pathological aversion to rigorous testing procedures because in almost every instance the performance of the weapon or weapons system is far below what it is advertised to be and, thus, far below the performance used to sell Congress on the idea in the first place.</div></li><li><div>But the moral element of conflict is a crucial part of “Patterns.” Boyd realized the Army was doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons, guarding a program worth billions of dollars, “protecting the farm” in Boyd’s words, while Burton wanted to protect the lives of American soldiers. The Army would try to steamroll Burton, to use the sheer mass of U.S. Army resources to crush him. It would be the crudest form of attrition warfare. Burton would have only his wits and the techniques of maneuver conflict. Boyd saw this as a chance for Burton to get inside the mind of the Army, to put the OODA Loop into action, to cause confusion and disorientation.</div></li><li><div>He and Burton spoke often of Churchill’s comment in World War II that the truth was too precious a commodity to travel alone—that it had to be protected by a “bodyguard of lies.” Boyd said Burton must break through the bodyguard of lies to find the truth. He told Burton to always keep the initiative. “<strong>And you must never panic. When they surprise you, even if the surprise seems fatal, there is always a countermove.”</strong></div></li><li><div>Boyd gave Burton three guiding principles.</div></li><ul><li><div>The first was the most difficult and most familiar to anyone who had worked with Boyd. “Jim, you can never be wrong. You have to do your homework. If you make a technical statement, you better be right. If you are not, they will hose you. And if they hose you, you’ve had it. Because once you lose credibility and you are no longer a threat, no one will pay attention to what you say. They won’t respect you and they won’t pay attention to you.”</div></li><li><div>The second thing Boyd told Burton was not to criticize the Bradley itself. “If you do, you are lumped in with all the other Bradley critics. It is the testing process you are concerned with.”</div></li><ul><li><div>While Boyd and Burton might make such a distinction, the Army could not. To them, criticizing the testing process was the same as criticizing the Bradley. But the difference in the two approaches is not at all subtle. By staying focused on the testing methodology, Burton was protecting the lives of American soldiers; he held the mental and moral high ground.</div></li></ul><li><div>Finally, Boyd counseled Burton not to talk to the media or to Congress, to stay inside the system. If you go outside the system, he said, you will be viewed as just another whistle blower. And whistle blowers get no respect; they get others to help them do something that they can’t do themselves.</div></li></ul><li><div>The Army did not want Burton around for those tests, however, so Army generals talked to Air Force generals, who sent down word that Burton was being transferred to Alaska. He was given a seven-day notice to accept the transfer or resign. It was just as Boyd predicted: a brutal, head-on assault. And it appeared effective. After all, if there is a bothersome employee, what better way to get rid of him than to transfer him? Burton thought the battle was over. But Boyd laughed. “Goddamn, Jim, this is the dumbest decision the Air Force can make. Whoever made this decision is general officer material.” He told Burton to collect every memo and every letter and every study in his files that dealt with the Bradley controversy, to make copies, and to flood the Building with little brothers and sisters.</div></li><li><div>Not even the most militant of Burton’s opponents could fault him for providing information to those connected with the Bradley program, so Burton emptied the contents of a filing cabinet and made copies of every document. He delivered copies to a number of people. A cover memo explained that he had been relieved of his job and that these documents should bring them up to speed on the status of the program. When he handed the stack of documents to a senior Army general, the general blanched. He knew copies would leak. Burton was giving notice that he was not only still in the game but was raising the stakes.</div></li><li><div>Several little brothers and sisters found their way to members of the Congressional Reform Caucus, who in turn told the press. Dozens of reporters showed up at the Pentagon wanting to know why Burton was being sent to Alaska. “Colonel Burton is not going to Alaska. There have been no such orders issued,” said a Pentagon spokesman.</div></li><li><div>The reporters went back to their sources in the Senate and House who gave them copies of the seven-day notice. When the reporters realized the Pentagon spokesman had lied to them, they were in a state of high dudgeon.</div></li><li><div>The first round was a clear victory for Burton. The generals must have been bitter. Not only had a colonel defied them and won but he had done it in such a way that they could not punish him.</div></li><li><div>By now Burton knew as much about ballistics and vaporifics and blast lung and all the other arcane disciplines as did the Army. He was inside their minds and knew how they thought and how they reacted. He could walk into a room of civilian and Army officials and know when the game was afoot. He knew intuitively when and how the adversary would move. Burton had the Fingerspitzengefuhl to move rapidly through the OODA Loop and stay ahead of his adversary, and he found the experience exhilarating. It gave him something like a “runner’s high” and he began to enjoy the confrontations. Each one began with his saying, “I want you to know there is nothing personal in what I am about to do.” And then total devastation. He wrote memos to his superiors that someone always leaked to congressmen, senators, and the media, causing the Army another round of ever-increasing embarrassment. He was planting a demon seed, and the Army would reap the harvest.</div></li><li><div>Civilian personnel, many of whom were former Army enlisted troops, realized that Burton, unlike many officers involved in the testing program, had no self-interest at stake. He was not there to get a medal and a promotion for pushing the Bradley into production; he wanted only to clean up the system for the benefit of troops in the field.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Thirty: They Think I’m a Kook</div></li><ul><li><div>Boyd often had counseled Spinney to have goals but to make sure the goals could not easily be reached. He talked of the desolation a man faced when he grew older and all his goals were realized. And now Boyd’s work had come full circle. He had reached all his goals.</div></li></ul><li><div>Chapter Thirty - One: The Ghetto Colonel and the SecDef</div></li><ul><li><div>Everything successful about the Gulf War is a direct reflection of Boyd’s “Patterns of Conflict”—multiple thrusts and deception operations that created ambiguity and caused the enemy to surrender by the thousands.</div></li><li><div>America not only picked when and where it would fight, but also when and where it would not fight. Coalition forces operated at a much higher tempo than the enemy.</div></li><li><div><strong>The underlying ideas of mutual trust, mission orders, and individual responsibility, and the concepts of “harmony” and “flow” and—most of all—the manipulation of time as a production tool were central ideas in both the Toyota system and the strategy of maneuver conflict.</strong></div></li><li><div>Richards found that a famous observation by Taiichi Ono, the Toyota vice president who created the Toyota system, held true: companies performing reasonably well will not adopt the Toyota system, although they may showcase isolated elements of lean production. Boyd put it more succinctly: “You can’t change big bureaucracies until they have a disaster.”</div></li><li><div><strong>John Richard Boyd—as is often the case with men of great accomplishment—gave his work far greater priority than he did his family.</strong></div></li><li><div>Burton learned from Boyd that if a man does the right thing, it does not matter how overwhelming the odds against him. There always is a way to victory. <strong>“No matter what the situation is, no matter how bleak or how dark things appear, how scary, there is always a way out,” Burton says. “It works every time. And it all goes back to Boyd’s ideas on maneuver conflict.”</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Every morning when Wyly arises, he asks himself, “What is my Schwerpunkt today?”</strong></div></li><li><div>He contributed as much to fighter aviation as any man in the history of the Air Force. He single-handedly moved the Air Force away from aircraft designed to fly at high speed in a straight line and toward the highly maneuverable aircraft of today. And more than any other person he deserves credit for creating America’s tactical Air Force of the past thirty years: the Air Force F-15 and F-16 and the Navy and Marine Corps F-18 rule the skies because of Boyd.</div></li><li><div>Boyd’s Energy-Maneuverability Theory did four things for aviation:</div></li><ul><li><div>It provided a quantitative basis for teaching aerial tactics,</div></li><li><div>It forever changed the way aircraft are flown in combat,</div></li><li><div>It provided a scientific means by which the maneuverability of an aircraft could be evaluated and tactics designed both to overcome the design flaws of one’s own aircraft and to minimize or negate the superiority of the opponent’s aircraft, and, finally,</div></li><li><div>It became a fundamental tool in designing fighter aircraft.</div></li></ul><li><div><strong>Boyd was the greatest military theoretician since Sun Tzu.</strong></div></li><li><div>Richards—considering that he has a Ph.D. in mathematics and is a retired intelligence officer—has a rather unusual assessment of Boyd: he thinks Boyd is the most recent link in a chain that began with Sun Tzu and continued with Musashi, the sixteenth-century samurai, and then with Mao Tse Tung. Richards says the similarities between Musashi and Boyd are many: Boyd’s shiny fighter aircraft was like the lacquered armor of a samurai. Both went into battle one-on-one. Both had personal habits that caused others to think them uncouth. Both lived by an austere code of honor and self-sacrifice. Both believed that if they confused an enemy before the battle, they had won even before the fight. In combat, neither ever lost a battle. Both read widely and were single-minded in their search for enlightenment. Both loomed large in their times. Both evolved from fighters into teachers and both left works that lived long after their death. Musashi’s famous work was A Book of Five Rings and Boyd’s was the OODA Loop. The OODA Loop is in five pieces, the “Loop” itself being the fifth. <strong>“Boyd was the old warrior,” Richards says.</strong></div></li></ul></ul>

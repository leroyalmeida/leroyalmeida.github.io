          <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><div>INTRODUCTION<br></div></li><ul><li><div>A choice architect has the responsibility for organizing the context in which people make decisions.</div></li></ul><ul><li><div><strong>Small and apparently insignificant details can have major impacts on people’s behavior.</strong> A good rule of thumb is to assume that “everything matters.” In many cases, the power of these small details comes from focusing the attention of users in a particular direction.</div></li></ul><ul><li><div>The insight that “everything matters” can be both paralyzing and empowering. Good architects realize that although they can’t build the perfect building, they can make some design choices that will have beneficial effects.</div></li></ul><ul><li><div>Libertarian Paternalism</div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>The libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like—and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Libertarian paternalists urge that people should be “free to choose.”</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>We strive to design policies that maintain or increase freedom of choice.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>The paternalistic aspect lies in the claim that it is legitimate for choice architects to try to influence people’s behavior in order to make their lives longer, healthier, and better. In other words, we argue for self-conscious efforts, by institutions in the private sector and also by government, to steer people’s choices in directions that will improve their lives.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>A policy is “paternalistic” if it tries to influence choices in a way that will make choosers better off, as judged by themselves.3</div></li></ul></ul><ul><li><div><strong>A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid.</strong></div></li></ul><ul><li><div>Humans and Econs: Why Nudges Can Help</div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>To qualify as Econs, people are not required to make perfect forecasts (that would require omniscience), but they are required to make unbiased forecasts. That is, the forecasts can be wrong, but they can’t be systematically wrong in a predictable direction.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>Planning fallacy: the systematic tendency toward unrealistic optimism about the time it takes to complete projects.</strong></div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>Status quo bias: People have a strong tendency to go along with the status quo or default option.</strong></div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Never underestimate the power of inertia. Second, that power can be harnessed.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><li><div>A False Assumption and Two Misconceptions</div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>The false assumption is that almost all people, almost all of the time, make choices that are in their best interest or at the very least are better than the choices that would be made by someone else.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>People make good choices in contexts in which they have experience, good information, and prompt feedback</strong>—say, choosing among ice cream flavors.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>The first misconception is that it is possible to avoid influencing people’s choices. In many situations, some organization or agent must make a choice that will affect the behavior of some other people. There is, in those situations, no way of avoiding nudging in some direction, and whether intended or not, these nudges will affect what people choose.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>In domains as varied as savings, organ donations, marriage, and health care, we will offer specific suggestions in keeping with our general approach. And by insisting that choices remain unrestricted, we think that the risks of inept or even corrupt designs are reduced. Freedom to choose is the best safeguard against bad choice architecture.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><li><div>Choice Architecture in Action</div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Choosers are human, so designers should make life as easy as possible. Send reminders, and then try to minimize the costs imposed on those who, despite your (and their) best efforts, space out.</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>PART I: HUMANS AND ECONS</div></li><ul><li><div>BIASES AND BLUNDERS</div></li><ul><li><div>How We Think: Two Systems</div></li><ul><li><div>We will call the first the Automatic System and the second the Reflective System. (In the psychology literature, these two systems are sometimes referred to as System 1 and System 2, respectively.)</div></li><li><div>The Automatic System is rapid and is or feels instinctive, and it does not involve what we usually associate with the word thinking.</div></li><li><div>The Reflective System is more deliberate and self-conscious.</div></li><li><div>The Automatic System can be trained with lots of repetition—but such training takes a lot of time and effort. One reason why teenagers are such risky drivers is that their Automatic Systems have not had much practice, and using the Reflective System is much slower.</div></li></ul><li><div>Rules of Thumb</div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Although rules of thumb can be very helpful, their use can also lead to systematic biases.</strong></div></li><li><div>Anchoring</div></li><ul><li><div>This process is called “anchoring and adjustment.” You start with some anchor, the number you know, and adjust in the direction you think is appropriate. So far, so good. The bias occurs because the adjustments are typically insufficient. Experiments repeatedly show that, in problems similar to our example, people from Chicago are likely to make a high guess (based on their high anchor) while those from Green Bay guess low (based on their low anchor).</div></li><li><div>Anchors serve as nudges. <strong>We can influence the figure you will choose in a particular situation by ever-so-subtly suggesting a starting point for your thought process.</strong></div></li></ul><li><div>Availability</div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Availability heuristic. They assess the likelihood of risks by asking how readily examples come to mind.</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Accessibility and salience are closely related to availability</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Vivid and easily imagined causes of death (for example, tornadoes) often receive inflated estimates of probability, and less-vivid causes (for example, asthma attacks) receive low estimates, even if they occur with a far greater frequency (here a factor of twenty).</strong> So, too, recent events have a greater impact on our behavior, and on our fears, than earlier ones.</div></li><li><div>The pervasive problems are that easily remembered events may inflate people’s probability judgments, and that if no such events come to mind, their judgments of likelihoods might be distorted downward.</div></li></ul><li><div>Representativeness</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>The idea is that when asked to judge how likely it is that A belongs to category B, people (and especially their Automatic Systems) answer by asking themselves how similar A is to their image or stereotype of B (that is, how “representative” A is of B).</div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>Optimism and Overconfidence</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>Unrealistic optimism is a pervasive feature of human life; it characterizes most people in most social categories. <strong>When they overestimate their personal immunity from harm, people may fail to take sensible preventive steps.</strong></div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>if people are reminded of a bad event, they may not continue to be so optimistic.</div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>Gains and Losses</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>Roughly speaking, losing something makes you twice as miserable as gaining the same thing makes you happy. In more technical language, people are “loss averse.”</strong></div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>What this means is that people do not assign specific values to objects. When they have to give something up, they are hurt more than they are pleased if they acquire the very same thing.</div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>Loss aversion helps produce inertia, meaning a strong desire to stick with your current holdings. If you are reluctant to give up what you have because you do not want to incur losses, then you will turn down trades you might have otherwise made.</strong></div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>Status Quo Bias</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>People have a more general tendency to stick with their current situation.</strong></div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>One of the causes of status quo bias is a lack of attention.</strong> Many people adopt what we will call the “yeah, whatever” heuristic.</div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>When renewal is automatic, and when people have to make a phone call to cancel, the likelihood of renewal is much higher than it is when people have to indicate that they actually want to continue to receive the magazine.</div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>The combination of loss aversion with mindless choosing implies that if an option is designated as the “default,” it will attract a large market share. Default options thus act as powerful nudges.</strong></div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>Framing</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>The idea is that choices depend, in part, on the way in which problems are stated.</strong></div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>Framing works because people tend to be somewhat mindless, passive decision makers.</strong> Their Reflective System does not do the work that would be required to check and see whether reframing the questions would produce a different answer.</div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div>RESISTING TEMPTATION</div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Temptation</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>In economics (and in ordinary life), a basic principle is that you can never be made worse off by having more options, because you can always turn them down.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>In the language of economics, the group is said to display behavior that is dynamically inconsistent. Initially people prefer A to B, but they later choose B over A.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>Temptation is easier to recognize than to define. Our preferred definition requires recognizing that people’s state of arousal varies over time.</strong></div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>For most of us, however, self-control issues arise because we underestimate the effect of arousal.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>This is something the behavioral economist George Loewenstein (1996) calls the “hot-cold empathy gap.” When in a cold state, we do not appreciate how much our desires and our behavior will be altered when we are “under the influence” of arousal.</strong></div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>Self-control problems can be illuminated by thinking about an individual as containing two semiautonomous selves, a far-sighted “Planner” and a myopic “Doer.”</div></li><ul><li><div>The Planner is trying to promote your long-term welfare but must cope with the feelings, mischief, and strong will of the Doer, who is exposed to the temptations that come with arousal.</div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Mindless Choosing</div></li><ul><li><div>Large plates and large packages mean more eating; they are a form of choice architecture, and they work as major nudges.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Mental Accounting<br></div></li><ul><li><div>According to economic theory (and simple logic), money is “fungible,” meaning that it doesn’t come with labels.<br></div></li><li><div>Mental accounting in action at the casino. Watch a gambler who is lucky enough to win some money early in the evening. You might see him take the money he has won and put it into one pocket and put the money he brought with him to gamble that evening (yet another mental account) into a different pocket.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>The money that has recently been won is called “house money” because in gambling parlance the casino is referred to as the house.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Experimental evidence reveals that people are more willing to gamble with money that they consider house money.</div></li><li><div>When investments pay off, people are willing to take big chances with their “winnings.”<br></div></li><li><div><strong>People are far more likely to splurge impulsively on a big luxury purchase when they receive an unexpected windfall than with savings that they have accumulated over time, even if those savings are fully available to be spent.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Using the money from the savings account to pay off the credit card debt amounts to what economists call an arbitrage opportunity— buying low and selling high—but the vast majority of households fail to take advantage.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div>FOLLOWING THE HERD</div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Humans are not exactly lemmings, but they are easily influenced by the statements and deeds of others.</strong></div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Conventional wisdom has it that if two people live together for a long time, they start to look like each other. This bit of folk wisdom turns out to be true. (For the curious: they grow to look alike partly because of nutrition—shared diets and eating habits—but much of the effect is simple imitation of facial expressions.) In fact couples who end up looking alike also tend to be happier!</div></li><li><div>Social influences come in two basic categories.</div></li><ul><li><div>The first involves information. <strong>If many people do something or think something, their actions and their thoughts convey information about what might be best for you to do or think. </strong></div></li><li><div>The second involves peer pressure. <strong>If you care about what other people think about you (perhaps in the mistaken belief that they are paying some attention to what you are doing—see below), then you might go along with the crowd to avoid their wrath or curry their favor.</strong><br></div></li></ul><li><div><strong>Humans are easily nudged by other Humans. Why? One reason is that we like to conform.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Doing What Others Do<br></div></li><ul><li><div>People become more likely to conform when they know that other people will see what they have to say. Sometimes people will go along with the group even when they think, or know, that everyone else has blundered. Unanimous groups are able to provide the strongest nudges—even when the question is an easy one, and people ought to know that everyone else is wrong.<br></div></li><li><div>A little nudge, if it was expressed confidently, could have major consequences for the group’s conclusion. The clear lesson here is that consistent and unwavering people, in the private or public sector, can move groups and practices in their preferred direction.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>“Collective conservatism”: the tendency of groups to stick to established patterns even as new needs arise.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Once a practice (like wearing ties) has become established, it is likely to be perpetuated, even if there is no particular basis for it. Sometimes a tradition can last for a long time, and receive support or at least acquiescence from large numbers of people, even though it was originally the product of a small nudge from a few people or perhaps even one.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>“Pluralistic ignorance”—that is, ignorance, on the part of all or most, about what other people think.</strong><br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>We may follow a practice or a tradition not because we like it, or even think it defensible, but merely because we think that most other people like it.</strong><br></div></li></ul></ul><li><div>The Spotlight Effect<br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>One reason why people expend so much effort conforming to social norms and fashions is that they think that others are closely paying attention to what they are doing.</strong><br></div></li></ul><li><div>Cultural Change, Political Change, and Unpredictability<br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Small interventions and even coincidences, at a key stage, can produce large variations in the outcome.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>An especially good way to gain weight is to have dinner with other people. On average, those who eat with one other person eat about 35 percent more than they do when they are alone; members of a group of four eat about 75 percent more; those in groups of seven or more eat 96 percent more.*<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Social Nudges as Choice Architecture<br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>If choice architects want to shift behavior and to do so with a nudge, they might simply inform people about what other people are doing.</strong><br></div></li></ul><li><div>Conformity and Tax Compliance<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Apparently some taxpayers are more likely to violate the law because of a misperception—plausibly based on the availability of media or other accounts of cheaters—that the level of compliance is pretty low. When informed that the actual compliance level is high, they become less likely to cheat. <strong>It follows that either desirable or undesirable behavior can be increased, at least to some extent, by drawing public attention to what others are doing.</strong></div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Socializing Non-drinking<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Incidents of alcohol abuse are easily recalled, and the consequence is to inflate perceptions. College students are influenced by their beliefs about what other college students do, and hence alcohol abuse will inevitably increase if students have an exaggerated sense of how much other students are drinking.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Smiles, Frowns, and Saving Energy<br></div></li><ul><li><div>In the following weeks, the above-average energy users significantly decreased their energy use; the below-average energy users significantly increased their energy use. The latter finding is called a boomerang effect, and it offers an important warning. <strong>If you want to nudge people into socially desirable behavior, do not, by any means, let them know that their current actions are better than the social norm.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Unsurprisingly, but significantly, the big energy users showed an even larger decrease when they received the unhappy emoticon. The more important finding was that when below-average energy users received the happy emoticon, the boomerang effect completely disappeared! When they were merely told that their energy use was below average, they felt that they had some “room” to increase consumption, but when the informational message was combined with an emotional nudge, they didn’t adjust their use upward.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Priming<br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Sometimes the merest hint of an idea or concept will trigger an association that can stimulate action. These “primes” occur in social situations, and their effects can be surprisingly powerful.</strong><br></div></li><li><div><strong>Those who engage in surveys want to catalogue behavior, not to influence it. But social scientists have discovered an odd fact: when they measure people’s intentions, they affect people’s conduct.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>The “mere-measurement effect” refers to the finding that when people are asked what they intend to do, they become more likely to act in accordance with their answers.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>The nudge provided by asking people what they intend to do can be accentuated by asking them when and how they plan to do it.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>This insight falls into the category of what the great psychologist Kurt Lewin called “channel factors,” a term he used for small influences that could either facilitate or inhibit certain behaviors.<br></div></li><ul><li><div>For people, Lewin argued that similarly tiny factors can create surprisingly strong inhibitors to behavior that people “want” to take. Often we can do more to facilitate good behavior by removing some small obstacle than by trying to shove people in a certain direction.<br></div></li></ul><li><div><strong>It turns out that if certain objects are made visible and salient, people’s behavior can be affected.</strong><br></div></li><ul><li><div>Objects characteristic of business environments, such as briefcases and boardroom tables, make people more competitive, less cooperative, and less generous.<br></div></li><li><div>Smells matter too: mere exposure to the scent of an all-purpose cleaner makes people keep their environment cleaner while they eat.<br></div></li><li><div>People’s judgments about strangers are affected by whether they are drinking iced coffee or hot coffee! Those given iced coffee are more likely to see other people as more selfish, less sociable, and, well, colder than those who are given hot coffee.<br></div></li></ul></ul></ul><li><div>WHEN DO WE NEED A NUDGE?<br></div></li><ul><li><div>The golden rule of libertarian paternalism: offer nudges that are most likely to help and least likely to inflict harm.<br></div></li><li><div>A slightly longer answer is that people will need nudges for decisions that are difficult and rare, for which they do not get prompt feedback, and when they have trouble translating aspects of the situation into terms that they can easily understand.<br></div></li><li><div>The key point here is that for all their virtues, markets often give companies a strong incentive to cater to (and profit from) human frailties, rather than to try to eradicate them or to minimize their effects.<br></div></li><li><div>Fraught Choices<br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Benefits Now—Costs Later</strong><br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Self-control issues are most likely to arise when choices and their consequences are separated in time.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>At one extreme are what might be called investment goods, such as exercise, flossing, and dieting.

The idea is that you want the signal you receive (the stimulus) to be consistent with the desired action. When there are inconsistencies, performance suffers and people blunder.<br></strong></div></li><li><div>Designers need to keep in mind that the users of their objects are Humans who are confronted every day with myriad choices and cues.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>If you indirectly influence the choices other people make, you are a choice architect.</strong> And since the choices you are influencing are going to be made by Humans, you will want your architecture to reflect a good understanding of how humans behave. In particular, you will want to ensure that the Automatic System doesn’t get all confused.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>Defaults: Padding the Path of Least Resistance</strong><br></div></li><ul><li><div>Recall the discussion of inertia, status quo bias, and the “yeah, whatever” heuristic. All these forces imply that <strong>if, for a given choice, there is a default option—an option that will obtain if the chooser does nothing—then we can expect a large number of people to end up with that option, whether or not it is good for them.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Defaults are ubiquitous and powerful. They are also unavoidable in the sense that for any node of a choice architecture system, there must be an associated rule that determines what happens to the decision maker if she does nothing.<br></div></li><li><div>The choice architect can force the choosers to make their own choice. We call this approach “required choice” or “mandated choice.”<br></div></li><ul><li><div>We believe that required choice, favored by many who like freedom, is sometimes the best way to go. But consider two points about that approach. First, Humans will often consider required choice to be a nuisance or worse, and would much prefer to have a good default.<br></div></li><li><div>Second, required choosing is generally more appropriate for simple yes-or-no decisions than for more complex choices.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>When choices are highly complex, required choosing may not be a good idea; it might not even be feasible.</strong><br></div></li></ul></ul><li><div><strong>Expect Error</strong><br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Humans make mistakes. A well-designed system expects its users to err and is as forgiving as possible.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Leaving the gas cap behind is a special kind of predictable error psychologists call a “postcompletion” error.2 The idea is that when you have finished your main task, you tend to forget things relating to previous steps.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>Forcing function: meaning that in order to get what you want, you have to do something else first.

So here is a choice-architecture question. If you are designing a drug, and you have complete flexibility, how often would you want your patients to have to take their medicine?</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>Birth control pills present a special problem along these lines, because they are taken every day for three weeks and then skipped for one week. To solve this problem and to make the process automatic, the pills are typically sold in a special container that contains twenty-eight pills, each in a numbered compartment. Patients are instructed to take a pill every day, in order. The pills for days twenty-two through twenty-eight are placebos whose only role is to facilitate compliance for Human users.</div></li><li><div>Visitors to London who come from the United States or Europe have a problem being safe pedestrians. They have spent their entire lives expecting cars to come at them from the left, and their Automatic System knows to look that way.<br></div></li><li><div>The city of London tries to help with good design. On many corners, especially in neighborhoods frequented by tourists, the pavement has signs that say, “Look right!”<br></div></li></ul><li><div><strong>Give Feedback</strong><br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>The best way to help Humans improve their performance is to provide feedback. Well-designed systems tell people when they are doing well and when they are making mistakes.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>An important type of feedback is a warning that things are going wrong, or, even more helpful, are about to go wrong.<br></div></li><li><div>Warning systems have to avoid the problem of offering so many warnings that they are ignored. If our computer constantly nags us about whether we are sure we want to open that attachment, we begin to click “yes” without thinking about it.<br></div></li></ul><li><div><strong>Understanding “Mappings”: From Choice to Welfare</strong><br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>A good system of choice architecture helps people to improve their ability to map and hence to select options that will make them better off.</strong> One way to do this is to make the information about various options more comprehensible, by transforming numerical information into units that translate more readily into actual use.<br></div></li></ul><li><div><strong>Structure Complex Choices</strong><br></div></li><ul><li><div>When we face a small number of well-understood alternatives, we tend to examine all the attributes of all the alternatives and then make trade-offs when necessary. But when the choice set gets large, we must use alternative strategies, and these can get us into trouble.<br></div></li><li><div>One strategy to use is what Amos Tversky (1972) called “elimination by aspects.” Someone using this strategy first decides what aspect is most important (say, commuting distance), establishes a cutoff level (say, no more than a thirty-minute commute), then eliminates all the alternatives that do not come up to this standard. The process is repeated, attribute by attribute (no more than $1,500 per month; at least two bedrooms; dogs permitted), until either a choice is made or the set is narrowed down enough to switch over to a compensatory evaluation of the “finalists.”<br></div></li><li><div>Social science research reveals that as the choices become more numerous and/or vary on more dimensions, people are more likely to adopt simplifying strategies.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>As alternatives become more numerous and more complex, choice architects have more to think about and more work to do, and are much more likely to influence choices (for better or for worse).</strong><br></div></li><li><div><strong>As choices become more numerous, though, good choice architecture will provide structure, and structure will affect outcomes.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Collaborative filtering is an effort to solve a problem of choice architecture. If you know what people like you tend to like, you might well be comfortable in selecting products you don’t know, because people like you tend to like them. For many of us, collaborative filtering is making difficult choices easier.<br></div></li></ul><li><div><strong>Incentives</strong><br></div></li><ul><li><div>If the price of a product goes up, suppliers will usually produce more of it and consumers will usually want less of it. So choice architects must think about incentives when they design a system. Sensible architects will put the right incentives on the right people.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>One way to start to think about incentives is to ask four questions about a particular choice architecture:<br></strong></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Who uses?</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Who chooses?</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Who pays?</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Who profits?</strong></div></li></ul><li><div>The most important modification that must be made to a standard analysis of incentives is salience. Do the choosers actually notice the incentives they face?<br></div></li><li><div>Salience can be manipulated, and good choice architects can take steps to direct people’s attention to incentives.<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Suppose in this light that government wants to increase energy conservation. Increases in the price of electricity will surely have an effect; making the increases salient will have a greater effect. Cost-disclosing thermostats might have a greater impact than (modest) price increases designed to decrease use of electricity.<br></div></li></ul></ul></ul><li><div><strong>NUDGES</strong>:</div></li><ul><li><div>i<strong>N</strong>centives<br></div></li><li><div><strong>U</strong>nderstand mappings</div></li><li><div><strong>D</strong>efaults</div></li><li><div><strong>G</strong>ive feedback</div></li><li><div><strong>E</strong>xpect error</div></li><li><div><strong>S</strong>tructure complex choices</div></li></ul></ul><li><div>PART II: MONEY</div></li><ul><li><div>SAVE MORE TOMORROW</div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>The standard economic theory of saving for retirement is both elegant and simple. People are assumed to calculate how much they are going to earn over the rest of their lifetime, figure out how much they will need when they retire, and then save up just enough to enjoy a comfortable retirement without sacrificing too much while they are still working.</div></li><ul><li><div>First, it assumes that people are capable of solving a complicated mathematical problem in order to figure out how much to save.<br></div></li><li><div>The second problem with the theory is that it assumes that people have enough willpower to implement the relevant plan.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Defined-benefit plans. In such plans, participants are entitled to a benefit that depends on a specific formula, typically based on the participant’s salary and the number of years the participant was a member of the plan. In a typical private plan, a worker is entitled to receive a benefit that is a proportion of the salary paid over the last few years of work, the proportion depending on years of service.<br></div></li><li><div>Under a defined-contribution plan, employees, and sometimes employers, make specific contributions to a tax-sheltered account in the employee’s name.<br></div></li><li><div>Defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans in the United States, have many desirable features for modern workers. The plans are completely portable, so a worker is free to move from one job to another. The plans are also flexible, giving employees the opportunity to adjust their savings and investment decisions to reflect their own financial situation and tastes.<br></div></li><li><div>Are People Saving Enough?<br></div></li><ul><li><div>The costs of saving too little are greater than the costs of saving too much.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Making Savings Automatic<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Automatic enrollment thus has two effects: participants join sooner, and more participants join eventually.<br></div></li><li><div>Under automatic enrollment, very few employees drop out of the plan once enrolled.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Forced Choosing and More Simplicity<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Get paid. With required choosing in place, employees have to state their preferences, and there is no default option<br></div></li><li><div>One company switched from an opt-in regime to active decisions and found that participation rates increased by about 25 percentage points.8<br></div></li><li><div>New employees were handed enrollment cards during orientation with a “yes” box for joining the plan at a 2 percent savings rate and a preselected asset allocation. Employees did not have to spend time choosing a savings rate and asset allocation; they could just check the “yes” box for participation. As a result, participation rates during the first four months of employment jumped from 9 percent to 34 percent.<br></div></li><li><div>While automatic enrollment or “quick” enrollment makes the process of joining a retirement plan less daunting, expanding the number of funds available to participants can have the opposite effect. One study finds that the more options in the plan, the lower the participation rates.10<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Choosing Contribution Rates<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Many employees continue saving at the default rate of 2 percent. This rate is usually far too low to provide enough money for retirement. Many employees also remain in the default investment fund, and they lose a lot of money as a result.<br></div></li><li><div>In many plans, participants are asked to state a desired savings rate as a percentage of pay. Many people simply pick a “round number,” typically 5, 10, or 15 percent of income.<br></div></li><li><div>Another common rule of thumb is to contribute to a retirement account the minimum amount necessary to get the full employer match. If the employer matches employees’ contributions up to 6 percent of pay, then many employees contribute 6 percent.<br></div></li><li><div>Changing the match formula from 50 percent on the first 6 percent of pay to 30 percent on the first 10 percent of pay would probably increase contribution rates.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Education</div></li><ul><li><div>Evidence does not suggest that education is, in and of itself, an adequate solution.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Save More Tomorrow<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Save More Tomorrow is a choice-architecture system that was constructed with close reference to five psychological principles that underlie human behavior:<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Many participants say that they think they should be saving more, and plan to save more, but never follow through.</div></li><li><div><strong>Self-control restrictions are easier to adopt if they take place some time in the future.

Once someone joins the program, the saving increases are automatic, using inertia to increase savings rather than prevent savings. When combined with automatic enrollment, this design can achieve both high participation rates and increased savings rates.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>Participation rates jump when enrollment is easy.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>The most effective way to increase enrollment in a Save More Tomorrow plan is to combine it with automatic enrollment.<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Ninety-three percent of participants took no action and thus were automatically enrolled in the program. In the year following the implementation of the program, only 6 percent actively opted out. Those who stayed in the program will have significantly more money available for retirement.<br></div></li><li><div>In the twelve months before the implementation of automatic enrollment, only 23 percent of employees opted into Save More Tomorrow. In the twelve months following automatic enrollment, 78 percent of the savers were participating in the program.<br></div></li></ul></ul><li><div>The Role of the Government<br></div></li><ul><li><div>The primary role government needed to play was getting out of the way by reducing the barriers to adoption of these programs.<br></div></li></ul></ul><li><div>NAÏVE INVESTING<br></div></li><ul><li><div>The switch from defined-benefit to defined-contribution plans has given employees more control, more options, and more responsibility.<br></div></li><li><div>The first question investors face is this: how much risk to take?<br></div></li><li><div>Choosing the appropriate mix of stocks and bonds (and possibly other assets such as real estate) is called the asset-allocation decision.<br></div></li><li><div>Chance that returns will actually be lower.

In the next two years, however, the allocation to equities for new participants fell back to 54 percent. Their market timing was backward. They were heavily buying stocks when stock prices were high, and then selling stocks when their prices were low.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Rules of Thumb<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Diversification heuristic.</div></li><ul><li><div>“When in doubt, diversify.” Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.</div></li><li><div>In general, diversification is a great idea, but there is a big difference between sensible diversification and the naïve kind.</div></li><li><div>A special case of this rule of thumb is what might be called the “1/n” heuristic: “When faced with ‘n’ options, divide assets evenly across the options.” Put the same number of eggs in each basket.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>The set of funds offered in a particular plan can greatly influence the choices participants make.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>The more stock funds the plan offered, the greater was the percentage of participants’ money invested in stocks.</strong><br></div></li></ul><li><div>Company Stock<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Often people do not diversify at all, and sometimes employees invest a lot of their money in their employer’s stock. Amazing but true: five million Americans have more than 60 percent of their retirement savings in company stock.8 This concentration is risky on two counts. First, a single security is much riskier than the portfolios offered by mutual funds. Second, as employees of Enron and WorldCom discovered the hard way, workers risk losing both their jobs and the bulk of their retirement savings all at once.<br></div></li><li><div>Plan participants tend to extrapolate past performance into the future.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>Past performance is no prediction of the future.</strong><br></div></li><li><div><strong>How risky is it to hold the shares of a single stock rather than a diversified portfolio? According to estimates by the economist Lisa Meulbroek (2002), a dollar in company stock is worth less than half the value of a dollar in a mutual fund!</strong> In other words, when firms foist company stock onto their employees, it is like paying them fifty cents on the dollar. The upshot is that, in general, workers would be much better off with a diversified mutual fund than with company stock.<br></div></li><li><div>Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA sets forth three fiduciary principles for retirement-plan investments: the exclusive benefit rule, requiring that plans be managed exclusively for the benefit of participants; the prudence rule, requiring that plan assets be invested according to a “prudent investor” standard; and the diversification rule, requiring that plan assets be diversified so as to minimize the risk of large losses.<br></div></li><li><div>No sensible definition of prudence can accommodate a concentrated position in a single stock—especially if that stock’s performance is correlated with participants’ work earnings.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Nudges<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Defaults<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Most specialists consider a 100 percent allocation to a money market account to be much too conservative. The combination of the low rates of return earned in these funds (barely above inflation) and the low savings rates by many employees is simply a recipe for being poor when you get old.<br></div></li><li><div>Many good default options are available. One alternative is to offer a set of model portfolios that have varying degrees of risk. We have noted that some plan sponsors offer conservative, moderate, and aggressive “lifestyle” portfolios.<br></div></li><li><div>Another option available to plan sponsors is to offer plan participants “target maturity funds.” Target maturity funds typically have a year in their name, like 2010, 2030, or 2040.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Structuring Complex Choices<br></div></li><ul><li><div>New enrollees would be told that if they do not want to select their own investment plan, they can choose the default fund that has been selected with some care by knowledgeable experts.<br></div></li><li><div>Participants who want to be somewhat more involved would be offered a choice among a small set of balanced or life-cycle funds (with the intention that each participant would invest all her money in a single fund).<br></div></li><li><div>For those who wanted to get really involved, a full menu of mutual funds would be offered, allowing sophisticated investors (or those who believe themselves to be sophisticated) the ability to invest as exotically as they choose.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Expect Error<br></div></li><ul><li><div>To help those who would not get it together to join, we encourage automatic enrollment, which we would combine with Save More Tomorrow to help people achieve an adequate savings rate. For those who did not invest in a life-cycle fund, we would recommend offering an automatic rebalancing plan so that a participant’s asset allocation would be adjusted over time.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Mappings and Feedback<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Most employees have difficulty understanding how numbers like savings rates, expected rates of return, and volatility translate into changes in their lifestyle when they are old. These abstract concepts can be brought into focus by offering translations into concepts anyone can understand.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Incentives<br></div></li><ul><li><div>The primary incentive problems in this context are possible conflicts of interest between the employer and the employee.</div></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div>CREDIT MARKETS</div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Mortgages</div></li><ul><li><div>The addition of more options has the potential to make people better off, but this potential is realized only if they are able to do a good job of picking the loan that is best suited to their situation and preferences.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>When markets get more complicated, unsophisticated and uneducated shoppers will be especially disadvantaged by the complexity.</strong> The unsophisticated shoppers are also more likely to be given bad or self-interested advice by people serving in roles that appear to be helpful and purely advisory. In this market, mortgage brokers who cater to rich clients probably have a greater incentive to establish a reputation for fair dealing. By contrast, mortgage brokers who cater to the poor are often more interested in making a quick buck.*</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>The good feature of subprime lending is that it offers credit to those who could not otherwise borrow, and makes it possible for some poor or high-risk families to become homeowners (or business owners).</div></li><li><div>Woodward’s research finds that the people who get the best deals—by a lot!—are those who pay no fee up front. (This just means that the broker pays all the fees out of his commission. There may be occasional free lunches, but there is no such thing as a free mortgage.) The likely explanation for this result is that when the fee is zero, it is simpler for borrowers to compare terms, because the interest rate is the only thing they have to look at.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Student Loans<br></div></li><ul><li><div>It is difficult to design public policies that inhibit “advisers” from taking that money. Better to inform the consumer by improving the choice architecture. If borrowers could compare loans more easily, then the price competition that was hoped for might actually emerge.<br></div></li><li><div>One helpful nudge would be to simplify the financial aid application. The complicated format of these forms can discourage students from applying for financial aid and cause them to seek pricey direct-to-consumer loans instead.<br></div></li><li><div>The FAFSA application could also be combined with an annual tax return. In one ongoing Ohio study, tax professionals at H&amp;R Block offer a FAFSA software package to families likely to qualify for federal or state financial aid.<br></div></li><li><div>Another possibility would be to help families avoid loans altogether, or at least reduce the need for such loans, by helping them start saving for college earlier via college savings accounts (“529 plans”).<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Credit Cards<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Credit cards serve two functions.</div></li><ul><li><div>First, they provide a mode of payment in lieu of cash, and have largely replaced checks for that purpose<br></div></li><li><div>The second purpose of a credit card is to provide a ready source of liquidity if you want to spend more than you currently have in cash.<br></div></li></ul><li><div><strong>Credit cards inhibit self-control</strong><br></div></li><ul><li><div>People were willing to pay twice as much to bid on tickets to a Boston Celtics basketball game if they could pay with their credit card rather than cash.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>One way credit card companies have slyly raised prices is by reducing the number of days you have between the time you get your bill and the day your payment is due. If you miss that payment you not only pay a penalty, but you also pay interest on all the purchases you make next month, even if you normally pay off your bill in full.<br></div></li><li><div>Second, the report would make more salient to users just how much they are paying over the course of the year.<br></div></li></ul></ul><li><div>PRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY: SMORGASBORD STYLE<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Design of the Swedish Privatization Plan</div></li><ul><li><div>The plan is a good example of the Just Maximize Choices strategy. Give people as many options as possible, and then let them do whatever they want. At almost every stage, the designers opted for a laissez-faire approach.<br></div></li><li><div>One fund was chosen (with some care) to be a default fund for anyone who, for whatever reason, did not make an active choice.<br></div></li><li><div>Participants were encouraged (via a massive advertising campaign) to choose their own portfolios, rather than rely on the default fund.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>The Default Fund<br></div></li><ul><li><div>We need to know something about the competence of those who design the default and the competence and diversity of those who might depart from it. If the designers are terrific, if the default fits all, and if the choosers are likely to blunder, then it might make sense to encourage people to select the default. If the designers are essentially guessing, if the choosers know a lot, and if the situations of different choosers are relevantly different, then it might be best to err on the size of official neutrality.<br></div></li><li><div>Participants were actively encouraged to choose their own portfolios via an extensive advertising campaign. This advertising effort seems to have had the desired effect, because two-thirds of participants did select portfolios on their own. Participants were more likely to make active choices if they had more money at stake, and, holding money constant, women and younger participants were more likely to make active choices.<br></div></li><li><div>One-third of the participants ended up with the default fund, and that figure might well seem high. It was, in fact, the largest market share of any fund.<br></div></li><li><div>As the government’s campaign diminished in intensity, people became significantly less likely to choose their own portfolios.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Did Active Choosers Make Good Choices?<br></div></li><ul><li><div>The default fund appears to have been chosen with some care (see Table 9.1). The asset allocation is 65 percent foreign (that is, non-Swedish) stocks, 17 percent Swedish stocks, 10 percent fixed-income securities (bonds),<br></div></li><li><div>First, although the allocation to stocks in the default plan was quite high, it is even higher in the portfolios actively chosen: 96.2 percent. People probably chose to invest so heavily in stocks because the stock market had been booming for the previous few years.<br></div></li><li><div>Second, the active choosers elected to invest nearly half their money (48.2 percent) in the stocks of Swedish companies. This reflects the well-known tendency of investors to buy stocks from their home country, something that economists refer to as the home bias.2<br></div></li><li><div>Third, only 4.1 percent of the funds in the selected portfolios were indexed. As a result, the fees paid by the active choosers are much higher: 0.77 percent compared with the 0.17 percent charged by the default fund.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>In summary, those who selected portfolios for themselves selected a higher equity exposure, more active management, much more local concentration, and higher fees.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>The default fund lost 29.9 percent in those three years, while the average portfolio of those participants who picked their funds actively lost 39.6 percent.<br></div></li><li><div>In subsequent years the default fund has continued to outperform people’s choices. Through July 2007 the default fund is up 21.5 percent while the average actively managed portfolio is up only 5.1 percent.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>Individual investors tend to be trend followers, rather than good forecasters, in their asset-allocation decisions.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Political judgments, no less than investment decisions, can be driven by recent, available events.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Advertising<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Only a small proportion of fund advertising can be construed as directly informative about characteristics relevant for rational investors, such as funds’ fees.<br></div></li><li><div>Fund advertising did strongly affect investors’ portfolio choices. It steered people into portfolios with lower expected returns (because of higher fees) and higher risk (through a higher exposure to equities, more active management, more “hot” sectors, and more home bias).<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Doing (Badly) Without Nudges<br></div></li><ul><li><div>The worst feature of the Swedish plan was the decision to encourage participants to choose their own portfolios. In complex situations, the government might actually be able to provide some useful hints. Recall a main lesson from Part 1: if the underlying decision is difficult and unfamiliar, and if people do not get prompt feedback when they err, then it’s legitimate, even good, to nudge a bit.<br></div></li><li><div>A better plan would start by following Sweden’s lead of choosing a good default plan, containing mostly index funds with managers selected by competitive bidding. Participants would then be guided through a simplified choice process (preferably on the Web). The process would start with a yes-or-no question: “Do you want the default fund?” For those who said yes, their task would be done (though of course they could always change their minds at a later date). Those who rejected the default would be offered a small set of blended funds, perhaps based on the age of the participant (again privately managed with competitive fees). Only participants who rejected all of these funds would get to the comprehensive list. Evidence from the private sector suggests that few participants would make use of the big list, but their right to do so would be fully protected.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>The more choices you give people, the more help you need to provide.</strong></div></li></ul></ul></ul><li><div>PART III: HEALTH</div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Social influences could obviously be enlisted: if most people think that most people are starting to avoid unhealthy foods, or to exercise, more people will avoid unhealthy foods and will exercise.</strong></div></li><li><div><strong>Framing matters: people are more likely to engage in self-examinations for skin and breast cancer if they are told not about the reduced risk if they do so but about the increased risk if they fail to do so.</strong></div></li><li><div>PRESCRIPTION DRUGS: PART D FOR DAUNTING</div></li><ul><li><div>Four major defects:</div></li><ul><li><div>It gave participants little guidance to help them make the best selections from that menu.</div></li><li><div>Its default option for most seniors was nonenrollment.</div></li><li><div>It chose a default at random (!) for six million people who were automatically enrolled, and it actively resisted efforts to match people and plans based on their prescription drug histories.</div></li><li><div>It failed to serve the most vulnerable population, specifically the poor and the poorly educated.</div></li></ul><li><div>Confusion Awaiting Clarity<br></div></li><ul><li><div>That offering people forty-six choices and telling them to ask for help is likely to be about as good as no help at all.<br></div></li><li><div>73 percent of seniors said Part D was “too complicated,” and 60 percent agreed with a statement that an unnamed party, most likely the government, should “select a handful of plans … so seniors have an easier time choosing.”<br></div></li><li><div>More than 90 percent of both doctors and pharmacists, who had been bombarded with patient questions throughout the enrollment period, agreed that the program was too complicated.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Random Default Plans for the Most Vulnerable<br></div></li><ul><li><div>The poorest and sickest enrollees are those people eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (and so are called the “dual eligibles”).<br></div></li><li><div>Dual eligibles are able to switch plans at any time—but if few are actively choosing plans, we suspect that few are taking advantage of the flexible switching option.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>Random assignment can cause random harm to unlucky people placed in plans that don’t fit their needs.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Some dual eligibles were defaulted into a plan that did not cover the drugs they use most.<br></div></li><li><div>Given the patchy drug access, it is not surprising that random plan defaults impaired people’s health. In a recent survey of dual eligibles, 10 percent reported improved medication access, while more than 22 percent said they had stopped taking medications temporarily or permanently because of problems in managing the new plan.10<br></div></li><li><div>The government’s official reason for rejecting intelligent assignment in favor of random assignment is that people’s prescription needs change.<br></div></li><li><div>Especially for the elderly, who are often on several long-term medications, last year’s drug use is often an excellent predictor of next year’s, and certainly it is a better predictor than picking a plan out of a hat.<br></div></li><li><div>It seems somewhere between callous and irresponsible to assign plans without even looking at people’s specific needs.<br></div></li><li><div>Most participants seem to find that the burden of switching—the time and energy it takes to decide on the best plan—is just not worth the effort.<br></div></li><li><div>Consider a comparative study of the prices of drugs covered by basic plans (the kind poor beneficiaries would be defaulted into) in three regions of the country. The study reported savings between $5 and $50 per drug per month when individuals are assigned to the lowest-cost, best-fitting basic drug plan.12<br></div></li><li><div>Choosing the right plan, rather than a random plan, has the potential to save both seniors and the government a lot of money.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Not User-Friendly<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Most seniors do not yet use the Internet, let alone the Medicare Web site, and those who do are rarely Web-savvy (though this will change over time). Most seniors get their information about Part D passively from mailings by insurers, the government, and groups like AARP. Those mailings are highly unlikely to contain personalized information. So the Web site is the best source for help.<br></div></li><li><div>We all got different estimates because prescription drug plans are constantly updating their drug prices.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Did Choosers Make Good Choices? Not Always<br></div></li><ul><li><div>You’ll need to compare plans along fifteen major dimensions.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>A good choice is one that meets a person’s specific needs.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Even in this simplified environment, a high percentage of seniors made poor choices among the four available plans, because they failed to connect their choices to their actual health, prescription use, and attitude toward risk. In all, nearly two-thirds of enrollees failed to choose the plan that minimized their out-of-pocket costs.17</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Intelligent Assignment<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Random default plan assignment is a terrible idea. If a poor person is assigned to a bad plan and does not switch, her drug bills may rise, or she may decide to stop taking an expensive drug, as some already have.<br></div></li><li><div>The government also pays more if it assigns someone to one plan if a different plan covers all that person’s drugs and costs 15 percent less.<br></div></li><li><div>Under random assignment, only one-third of the beneficiaries were placed in plans that covered all of their recently used drugs, and one-quarter were in plans that covered fewer than 60 percent of those drugs.19<br></div></li><li><div>Participants in plans covering fewer than 80 percent of their required drugs were switched automatically (with participants retaining the option to cancel the reassignment). Another set of participants received letters informing them that better matches existed, and were advised to contact state officials for more information.<br></div></li></ul></ul><li><div>RECAP<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Here’s how RECAP would work. Once a year, just before the enrollment period opens, companies would send seniors a complete, itemized list of all the drugs used over the previous year and all the fees incurred.<br></div></li><li><div>The purpose of the information would be to nudge seniors away from a status quo bias and encourage comparison shopping by making prescription drug costs as salient as possible.<br></div></li><li><div>One goal would be to highlight for seniors how much money a delay costs them.<br></div></li><li><div>The RECAP information could also be used to improve intelligent assignment programs. One research team has produced some preliminary evidence that a RECAP-style nudge has promise.<br></div></li><li><div>To see whether people would take advantage of these savings with a slight nudge, the researchers mailed a personal letter to a random sample of study participants who had agreed to share their personal drug histories. The letter explained the costs in their current plan, the cheapest comparable plan, and the savings they could realize by switching plans. Another random sample of participants received generic Part D brochures instead.<br></div></li><li><div>The personal letters appear to have nudged more people to pick lower-cost plans. The overall switch rate among seniors receiving letters was 27 percent—10 percentage points higher than among those receiving brochures.<br></div></li><li><div>These results are consistent with other studies showing that people are making errors in their choices among plans, and that simple, clear information can reduce those errors.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>In complex situations, the Just Maximize Choices mantra is not enough to create good policy.

Of those who stated they personally wanted to donate their organs, only 64% had marked their driver’s license and only 36% had signed an organ donor card.”<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Routine Removal<br></div></li><ul><li><div>The most aggressive approach, which is more than a default rule, is called routine removal. Under this regime, the state owns the rights to body parts of people who are dead or in certain hopeless conditions, and it can remove their organs without asking anyone’s permission.<br></div></li><li><div>In Georgia, for example, routine removal increased the number of corneal transplants from twenty-five in 1978 to more than one thousand in 1984.3<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Presumed Consent<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Under this policy, all citizens would be presumed to be consenting donors, but they would have the opportunity to register their unwillingness to donate, and they could do so easily.<br></div></li><li><div>The default mattered—a lot. When participants had to opt in to being an organ donor, only 42 percent did so. But when they had to opt out, 82 percent agreed to be donors. Surprisingly, almost as many people (79 percent) agreed to be donors in the neutral condition.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Some Complexities<br></div></li><ul><li><div>U.S. donation rate is higher than in many presumed consent countries because of the superiority of the American medical system in quickly matching consenting donors with recipients, delivering the organs, and performing successful transplants. The default consent rule, therefore, is not the only thing that matters.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>Holding everything else constant, switching from explicit consent to presumed consent increases the donation rate in a country by roughly 16 percent.</strong><br></div></li><li><div><strong>The rejection rate is much lower in countries with presumed consent rules, even though there is typically no record of the donor’s wishes.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>A system of presumed consent allows organ procurement organizations and hospital staff to approach the family as the family of a ‘donor’ rather than as the family of a ‘nondonor.’<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Mandated Choice<br></div></li><ul><li><div>With mandated choice, renewal of your driver’s license would be accompanied by a requirement that you check a box stating your organ donation preferences.<br></div></li><li><div>Experimental evidence in other domains suggests that if you give people the option to procrastinate about making a decision, they will often take that option.<br></div></li><li><div>It seems likely that family members would be more willing to respect the expressed wishes of a donor who actively said “yes” compared with a donor who simply failed to say “no.”</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div>SAVING THE PLANET</div></li><ul><li><div>It helps to think about the environment as the outcome of a global choice architecture system in which decisions are made by all kinds of actors,<br></div></li><li><div>Two problems that contribute to environmental problems.<br></div></li><ul><li><div>First, incentives are not properly aligned. If you engage in environmentally costly behavior next year, through your consumption choices, you will probably pay nothing for the environmental harms that you inflict. This is what is often called a “tragedy of the commons.”<br></div></li><li><div>The second problem that contributes to excessive pollution is that people do not get feedback on the environmental consequences of their actions.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Better Incentives<br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>When incentives are badly aligned, it is appropriate for government to try to fix the problem by realigning them.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Two broad approaches have been proposed.</div></li><ul><li><div>The first is to impose taxes or penalties on those who pollute.<br></div></li><li><div>The second approach is called a cap-and-trade system. In such systems those who pollute are given (or sold) “rights” to pollute in certain amounts (the “cap”) and these rights are then traded in a market.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Incentive-based approaches are more efficient and more effective, and they also increase freedom of choice.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>Liberty is much greater when people are told, “You can continue your behavior, so long as you pay for the social harm that it does” than when they are told, “You must act exactly as the government says.” Companies much prefer cap-and-trade systems to rigid government commands, because such systems allow more freedom and impose lower costs.</strong><br></div></li><li><div><strong>Much of the time, the best approach to pollution problems is to impose a tax on the harmful behavior and to let market forces determine the response to the increased cost.</strong><br></div></li><li><div><strong>Raising the tax on gasoline, for example, would eventually induce drivers to buy more fuel-efficient cars, drive less, or both.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Cap-and-trade system is similar in spirit and approach. In the pollution context, people who reduce their pollution below a specified level are allowed to trade their “emissions rights” for cash.<br></div></li><li><div>Such a system creates market-based disincentives to pollute and market-based incentives for pollution control. Such a system also rewards rather than punishes technological innovation in pollution control,<br></div></li><li><div>Announcing a new fuel efficiency standard sounds misleadingly “free,” whereas imposing a carbon tax sounds expensive, even if it is actually a cheaper way of achieving the same goal.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Feedback and Information<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Costs of pollution are hidden, while the price at the pump is quite salient.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>Information is a surprisingly strong motivator.</strong><br></div></li></ul><ul><li><div>Some disclosure statutes are designed to trigger political rather than market mechanisms; here the goal is not to give consumers feedback on their decisions but to inform voters and their representatives.<br></div></li><li><div>The purpose of disclosure is to activate political safeguards, coming from the government’s own judgments once the environmental effects are made clear, or from external pressure on the part of citizens who have learned about those effects.<br></div></li><li><div>One reason that the Toyota Prius has been so successful compared with other hybrid cars is that the Prius is sold only as a hybrid (unlike, say, a Camry, which is sold in both conventional and hybrid versions). People who want to signal their green credentials are much happier in a Prius than a hybrid Camry because no one will know that the Camry is a hybrid unless she carefully examines some labeling on the car.<br></div></li><li><div>Incentive problems permeate the home-building industry because the costs of making a home more energy efficient are borne up front by the builder, whereas the costs of heating and cooling are later paid by the owners.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Ambitious Environmental Nudges<br></div></li><ul><li><div>We can find ways to make energy use visible, we’ll nudge people toward reducing their energy use without mandating any such reductions.<br></div></li><li><div>Even in a free market, companies often fail to use the latest products, and sometimes government can help them to make money while also reducing pollution.<br></div></li></ul></ul></ul><li><div>PART IV: FREEDOM</div></li><ul><li><div>IMPROVING SCHOOL CHOICES</div></li><ul><li><div>The case for choice was originally popularized by the great libertarian economist Milton Friedman. His argument is a simple one: the best way to improve our children’s schools is to introduce competition. If schools compete, kids win. And if schools compete, those who are the least advantaged have the most to gain.<br></div></li><li><div>The evidence suggests that while choice programs are hardly a panacea, they can indeed improve student performance.<br></div></li><li><div>when facing competition, public schools produce higher student achievement per dollar spent. Test-score improvements can range from 1 to 7 percent a year depending on the school and student—and improvement is usually greatest among younger students, low-income students, and minority-group members.2<br></div></li><li><div>Complex Choices and Mental Shortcuts<br></div></li><ul><li><div>When parents pick schools, status quo bias plays a big role. The neighborhood school that one knows, failing or not, may be preferable to the unknown school half an hour away. In any case, the Byzantine nature of collecting and distributing school data makes it difficult for parents to think through their options.<br></div></li><li><div>Low-income parents tended to put less weight than high-income parents on school quality, as measured by test scores, and rarely tried to enroll in higher-performing schools.<br></div></li><li><div>The parents who received the fact sheets made decisions implying that the weight they assigned to school quality (as measured by test scores) had doubled. The schools they selected had, on average, 70 percent higher test scores than the scores at their neighborhood schools. This had the effect of making their choices similar to those of families whose incomes were $65,000 a year higher.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Nudging High Schoolers Toward College<br></div></li><ul><li><div>In San Marcos, Texas, the school superintendent and an administrator at nearby Austin Community College were looking for a way to get more of San Marcos’s largely Latino student population into college.<br></div></li><li><div>The nudge was this: in order to graduate from San Marcos High, a student would have to complete an application to nearby Austin Community College. Because all it takes to get admitted to the community college is a high school degree and a record of having taken a standardized test, completing the application properly was tantamount to acceptance.<br></div></li><li><div>In a smart piece of mapping, the counselors didn’t try to sell the students on the high-mindedness of education. Instead, they hooked them with the universal symbol of teenage freedom: the automobile. They talked about how much more money college graduates earned compared with high school graduates, explaining it as the difference between a Mercedes and a KIA.<br></div></li><li><div>The major problem, and our principal concern here, is that what is true for investments and prescription drugs is true for education as well: it is not enough to make lots of choices available and then hope parents choose wisely. School systems need to put parents in a position to think through their choices, and to exercise their freedom rather than to rely on the default option.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div>SHOULD PATIENTS BE FORCED TO BUY LOTTERY TICKETS?</div></li><ul><li><div>Health care is really expensive. It is expensive in part because Americans want access to all the best services:<br></div></li><li><div>There is something that every health care customer in America is forced to buy, whether she wants it or not: the right to sue the doctor for negligence.<br></div></li><li><div>It is not possible to buy the insurance à la carte, with reduced rights to sue people if they mess up.<br></div></li><li><div>Similarly, many patients and health care providers would gladly enter into an arrangement to eliminate the right to sue for negligence.* In return for a waiver of that right, a doctor, hospital, or insurance carrier could offer a patient a lower price for health care. Some patients would choose to take the lower price and assume the risk themselves. Others would prefer to waive medical malpractice liability and instead buy private disability or injury insurance. But these arrangements aren’t available to patients, because courts have long held that waivers of medical malpractice liability are unenforceable as “against public policy.” These rulings are the opposite of libertarian; they deny people the freedom to make contracts as they see fit.<br></div></li><li><div>Exposure to medical malpractice liability has been estimated to account for 5 to 9 percent of hospital expenditures—which means that litigation costs are a contributor to the expense of the health care system.3<br></div></li><li><div>The full costs of litigation actually include much more than judgments that are paid to plaintiffs and the costs of litigation—the “direct costs.” There are indirect costs as well, and patients must bear those costs too.<br></div></li><li><div>Many doctors practice “defensive medicine,” ordering expensive but unnecessary treatments for patients, or refusing to provide risky but beneficial treatments, simply in order to avoid liability.<br></div></li><li><div>Error reporting in hospitals and among physicians is discouraged.<br></div></li><li><div>It is not clear that patients gain a lot from the right to sue. At the same time, part of the current cost is passed onto patients, in the form of higher bills, and defensive medicine can be bad medicine for those who want good care.<br></div></li><li><div>This is the key point—courts will block any deal between patients and providers that exchanges lower-cost treatment for a waiver of the patient’s right to sue.<br></div></li><li><div>Why do courts block such deals? The answer is nonlibertarian paternalism, pure and simple. Courts appear to think that sensible patients would not waive their right to sue, and that doctors should not be treating patients without the threat of malpractice liability to deter negligent treatment.<br></div></li><li><div>One reason to allow patients the option of giving up the right to sue is that the deterrent effect of tort liability is overstated.<br></div></li><li><div>A doctor will pay the same premium no matter how many times he has been sued for malpractice. Of course, any doctor would like to avoid the ordeal and embarrassment of a malpractice lawsuit, but she generally need not fear the financial burden imposed by one.<br></div></li><li><div>The deterrence argument is also undermined by the stunningly poor fit between malpractice claims and injuries caused by medical negligence. To put it bluntly, most patients don’t sue even if their doctor has been negligent, and many of those who do sue, and end up with favorable settlements, don’t deserve the money.<br></div></li><li><div>Most patients who are harmed by medical malpractice do not get any compensation, and many patients who do receive compensation were not harmed at all or were not treated negligently.<br></div></li><li><div>If you can save something by waiving your right to sue, you might well elect to do that. The point is especially important for people without a lot of money. Since it is impossible to buy medical treatment without implicitly buying the right to sue, sick people who can afford treatment but not the package of treatment plus suit option will drop out of the market.<br></div></li><li><div>Another problem with the current system is that jury awards for the pain and suffering that may be associated with a medical malpractice claim are highly erratic.7 It is difficult to predict, from the facts of the case, whether a plaintiff will get a lot or a little.<br></div></li><li><div>We recognize that patients might find it hard to understand the nature of medical malpractice liability and the consequences of waiver. Waiving liability should not be done lightly or impulsively. In other domains, this view is reflected in state law, which often requires waivers to be accompanied by procedural safeguards designed to ensure that the waiving party is fully informed. Waivers generally must be in writing and must state precisely what is being waived.<br></div></li><li><div>If waiving the right to sue were the default, and retaining it would cost extra, most patients would probably waive (recall that the default option usually sticks).</div></li></ul></ul><ul><li><div>PRIVATIZING MARRIAGE</div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>The state would do its business, while religious organizations would do theirs. We would eliminate the ambiguity created by the fact that the word marriage now refers both to an official (legal) status and to a religious one.</div></li><li><div>What Is Marriage?<br></div></li><ul><li><div>As a matter of law, marriage is no more and no less than an official status, created by the state and accompanied by government entitlements and mandates.</div></li><li><div>When you are married, you get many material benefits, economic and noneconomic:</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>Tax benefits (and burdens).</div></li><li><div>Entitlements.<br></div></li><li><div>Inheritance and other death benefits.<br></div></li><li><div>Ownership benefits.<br></div></li><li><div>Surrogate decision making.<br></div></li><li><div>Evidentiary privileges.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>When people marry, they receive not only material benefits but also a kind of official legitimacy, a stamp of approval, from the state.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>State Control of Marriage Is Anachronistic<br></div></li><ul><li><div>The institution of state-run marriage has a highly discriminatory past, enmeshed as it has been in both sexual and racial inequality.<br></div></li><li><div>Marriage might be seen, in part, as a solution to a self-control problem, in which people take steps to increase the likelihood that their relationship will endure. If divorce is difficult, then marriages are more likely to be stable.<br></div></li><li><div>Official marriage licenses also have the unfortunate consequence of dividing the world into the status of those who are “married” and those who are “single,” in a way that produces serious economic and material disadvantages for the latter (and sometimes for the former).<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Is Official Marriage Beneficial?<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Marriage has often been understood as a means of protecting children, and it should be unnecessary to say that this goal is important. But the official institution of marriage is an exceedingly crude tool for providing that protection,<br></div></li><li><div>In any case, there is no reason to think that civil unions and private arrangements, religious and otherwise, cannot provide as much protection of children as official marriage does.<br></div></li><li><div>The state does not simply permit people to marry within their religions; it does not merely enforce people’s agreements. It also creates a monopoly on the legal form of marriage; imposes sharp limits on who may enter and how; and accompanies the legal form with material and symbolic benefits that it alone confers.<br></div></li><li><div>Is government licensing with the term marriage necessary at all? Many commitments are stable without licenses from the state.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Nudging Couples<br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Nearly 100 percent of people believe that they are certain or almost certain not to get divorced!</strong><br></div></li><li><div>It is in these circumstances, and in part for that reason, that people are immensely reluctant to make prenuptial agreements.</div></li><li><div>When prenuptial agreements have not been made, we believe that the relevant rules should nudge the outcome in a way that will help the weakest parties—usually women. Typically, a woman’s economic prospects fall after divorce, whereas the prospects of the man increase.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul><li><div>Aside from helping the vulnerable, default rules should be clear in this arena, because Humans, unlike Econs, have a self-serving bias when it comes to negotiating settlements. Essentially, the self-serving bias means that in difficult or important negotiations, we tend to think that both the objectively “fair” outcome and the most likely outcome is the one that is skewed in our own favor.</div></li><li><div>The upshot is that where the law is unclear, long and intense disputes are likely. Both sides would benefit if they could be nudged toward a smaller range of expected outcomes, so that their expectations will have some overlap.<br></div></li><li><div>Families facing divorce will gain if the law provides an anchor or range, helping people know what constitutes a fair or likely outcome.<br></div></li><li><div>The best solution is to introduce something not unlike criminal sentencing guidelines—a fairly narrow range of possible outcomes within which a judge has discretion to consider other factors.</div></li></ul></ul></ul><li><div>PART V: EXTENSIONS AND OBJECTIONS</div></li><ul><li><div>A DOZEN NUDGES</div></li></ul><ul><ul><li><div>Give More Tomorrow.</div></li><ul><li><div>Ask people whether they would like to give a small amount to their favorite charities starting sometime soon, then commit to increasing their donations every year.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>The Charity Debit Card and tax deductions.<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Keeping track of donations and listing them on a tax return is burdensome for some Humans, who end up donating less than they would if the tax savings were automatic.<br></div></li><li><div>With the Charity Debit Card, any charitable donations are deducted from your normal account, and your bank sends you a statement at the end of the year with your donations itemized and totaled.<br></div></li><li><div>The statement could even be sent straight to the irs so that the government could automatically process the appropriate deduction for you.

The plan features a Health Vitality Program explicitly designed to give people an incentive to make healthy choices. A participant is able to earn “Vitality Bucks” if he works out at a health club in a particular week, has a child join a soccer league, or completes a blood-pressure check with normal results. Vitality Bucks can be used to obtain airline tickets, hotel rooms, magazine subscriptions, and electronics.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Dollar a day.<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Teenage girls with a baby receive a dollar for each day in which they are not pregnant.<br></div></li><li><div>Dollar a day is a trivial cost to the city, even for a year or two, so the plan’s total cost is extremely low, but the small recurring payment is salient enough to encourage teenage mothers to take steps to avoid getting pregnant again.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Filters for air conditioners; the helpful red light.<br></div></li><ul><li><div>People should be informed via a red light in a relevant and conspicuous place that the filter needs to be changed.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>No-bite nail polish and Disulfiram.<br></div></li><ul><li><div>The Reflective System can choose to discipline the Automatic System through products that tell the Automatic System: Stop!<br></div></li><li><div>Those who want to stop biting their nails can buy bitter nail polishes such as Mavala and Orly No Bite.<br></div></li><li><div>Disulfiram causes alcohol drinkers to throw up and suffer a hangover as soon as they start to drink.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>The Civility Check.<br></div></li><ul><li><div>We propose a Civility Check that can accurately tell whether the email you’re about to send is angry and caution you, “WARNING: THIS APPEARS TO BE AN UNCIVIL EMAIL.

And if our proposals are worthwhile, then let’s make progress on those,<br></div></li></ul><li><div>The second response is that our own libertarian condition, requiring low-cost opt-out rights, reduces the steepness of the ostensibly slippery slope. Our proposals are emphatically designed to retain freedom of choice.<br></div></li><li><div>The third point is one that we have emphasized throughout: In many cases, some kind of nudge is inevitable, and so it is pointless to ask government simply to stand aside. Choice architects, whether private or public, must do something.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>To be sure, the default terms that now apply in any particular context might be best, in the sense that they promote people’s interests overall or on balance. But that view must be defended, not assumed.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Evil Nudgers and Bad Nudges<br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Try to line up incentives when we can, and employ monitoring and transparency when we can’t.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>One question is whether we should worry even more about public choice architects than private choice architects. Maybe so, but we worry about both.<br></div></li><li><div>When consumers are confused about the features of the products they are buying, it can be profit maximizing to exploit their confusion, especially in the short run but possibly in the long run too.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>The invisible hand works best when products are simple and purchased frequently. We worry very little about consumers being ripped off by their dry cleaners.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>We should create rules of engagement that reduce fraud and other abuses, that promote healthy competition, that restrict interest-group power, and that create incentives to make it more likely that the architects will serve the public interest. In both the public and private sectors, a primary goal should be to increase transparency.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>The Right to Be Wrong<br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>For unsophisticated choosers, there is little harm in putting some warning signs along the way.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Should pedestrians in London get hit by a double-decker bus to teach them to “look right”? Isn’t a reminder on the sidewalk better?<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Of Punishment, Redistribution, and Choice<br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>A good society makes trade-offs between protecting the unfortunate and encouraging initiative and self-help—between giving everyone a decent share of the pie and increasing the size of the pie.</strong><br></div></li><li><div><strong>Nudging helps those who need help while imposing minimal costs on those who do not.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>If the people who need the help are also imposing costs on society—for example, through higher health costs— then having the Econs share in the costs of helping the Humans seems like a modest price to pay.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>Forced choosing is not always best. When the choices are hard and the options are numerous, requiring people to choose for themselves might be preferred and might not lead to the best decisions.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Forcing people to choose is not always wise, and remaining neutral is not always possible.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Drawing Lines and the Publicity Principle<br></div></li><ul><li><div>So do we embrace subliminal advertising—so long as it is in the interest of desirable ends? What limits should be placed on private or public manipulation as such? A general objection to libertarian paternalism, and to certain kinds of nudges, might be that they are insidious—that they empower government to maneuver people in its preferred directions, and at the same time provide officials with excellent tools by which to accomplish that task.<br></div></li><li><div>In its simplest form, the publicity principle bans government from selecting a policy that it would not be able or willing to defend publicly to its own citizens.<br></div></li><li><div>If a government adopts a policy that it could not defend publicly, it stands to face considerable embarrassment, and perhaps much worse, if the policy and its grounds are disclosed.<br></div></li><li><div>The government should respect the people whom it governs, and if it adopts policies that it could not defend in public, it fails to manifest that respect. Instead, it treats its citizens as tools for its own manipulation.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Neutrality<br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Our basic conclusion is that the evaluation of nudges depends on their effects—on whether they hurt people or help them.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>We agree that in some cases, forced choosing is best. But often it is not feasible, and sometimes it is more trouble than it is worth.<br></div></li><li><div>Education and advertising campaigns are optional, and they can be avoided. Should governments educate people about the risks of smoking and drinking, unprotected sex, trans fats, spike-heeled shoes? Should employers offer educational campaigns about similar topics? To answer these questions, we need to know something about the Nudgers and the Nudgees. One question is whether an outside agent (the Nudger) is likely to be able to help an individual (the Nudgee) make a better choice. Part of this depends on how hard the choices are for the Nudgees. As we have seen, people are most likely to need nudges for decisions that are difficult, complex, and infrequent, and when they have poor feedback and few opportunities for learning.<br></div></li><li><div><strong>Nudgers will be able to make good guesses when they have much more expertise at their disposal, and when the differences in individuals’ tastes and preferences are either not very big (nearly everyone prefers chocolate ice cream to licorice) or when differences in tastes and needs can be easily detected (as when the government deduces that you are likely to prefer a drug plan that offers low prices on the drugs you take regularly).</strong><br></div></li><li><div><strong>When choices are fraught, when Nudgers have expertise, and when differences in individual preferences are either not important or can be easily estimated, then the potential for helpful nudging is high.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>If the Nudgers are incompetent, then they could easily do more harm than good by directing people’s choices. And if the risk of self-dealing is high, then it is right to be wary of attempts to nudge.<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Why Stop at Libertarian Paternalism?<br></div></li><ul><li><div><strong>Our goal is to allow people to go their own way at the lowest possible cost.</strong><br></div></li><li><div><strong>Asymmetric paternalism: Their guiding principle is that we should design policies that help the least sophisticated people in society while imposing the smallest possible costs on the most sophisticated.</strong><br></div></li><li><div>Suppose that for a modest cost, the sunlamp can be equipped with a timer switch set so that it can be turned on only for brief periods, after which it shuts off automatically—a design common for the warming lamps found in some hotel bathrooms. Should the government require that all sunlamps be sold with such a switch? Asymmetrical paternalists believe that the answer depends on some kind of cost-benefit analysis. If the cost of the switch is low enough and the risk of burns is high enough, then the answer is yes.<br></div></li><li><div>Mandatory cooling-off periods make best sense, and tend to be imposed, when two conditions are met: (a) people make the relevant decisions infrequently and therefore lack a great deal of experience, and (b) emotions are likely to be running high. These are the circumstances in which people are especially prone to making choices that they will regret.<br></div></li><li><div>Deciding where to stop, and when to call a nudge a shove (much less a prison), is tricky. Where mandates are involved and opt-outs are unavailable, the slippery-slope argument can begin to have some merit, especially if regulators are heavy-handed.<br></div></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li><div>THE REAL THIRD WAY</div></li><ul><li><div>Seemingly small features of social situations can have massive effects on people’s behavior; nudges are everywhere, even if we do not see them. Choice architecture, both good and bad, is pervasive and unavoidable, and it greatly affects our decisions.</div></li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li><div><strong>Choice architects can preserve freedom of choice while also nudging people in directions that will improve their lives.</strong></div></li></ul></ul>
